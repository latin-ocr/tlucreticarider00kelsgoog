once of forces ; but sometime keotmoy conquer moisture, or molsturc lacot.
Once, it is said, fire prevoiled, and once water ; the like may hoppen again
with destrmtion morefar·reaclring. 380-415.

381. membra: four members are mentioned 235-6; but the poet
here speaks only of the striie between tire and water. In the last
paragraph the external causes of destruction were discussed; he now
takes up the causes that may lurk within the world itself. —pio ne-
quaquam: because os their relationship. 382Ἰ ollis: see nto
1, 672. 383. vel cum etc: another vel would be expected, as
Munro observes, to complete the constr.; but at 386 the poet gives a
different turn to the thought, and changes the torm ol the sentence.
Instances of a like change of constr. are not uncommon. With this
striie between fire and water Lambinus compares the famous θεῶν
μάχη, or contest between Apollo and Neptune, in Homer. Anaximan-
der held that the sca would sometime dry up; this must lead to the

burning up of the earth, as the elements of heat and fire would then

preponderate. Heraclitus taught that the present order ol things
would come to an end in a great conflagration; see nto 1, 638. Cer-
tain of the Stoics believed that the world is sometimes destroyed by
fire and sometimes by floods‚ a new world always coming into exist·
enee after afixed period. To the last point Boethius made the apt ’
objection that if the world burned up, the fire aster a time must needs
go out tor lack of fuel, and there would be nothing leit to make a new
world out of. Xenophanes too, seems to have taught the periodical
visitation of the earth by lloods. 387. diluviare: not found else-
where. 'l’he thought of 386-7 is explained by 269-272. 388·9. Cf.
266-7. 394. cum: concessive. 394 is explained below 396-4053
395, 411-2. 396. superat: = superavit ; see n. on 1, 70 inritat.
397. Phaethonta: the poet interprets the mythol Phaeton alter the
manner of the Stoics,supposing it to have abasis of fact in some vast
and destructive conflagration. For a similar explanation ot the story
see Keightley’s ‘ Mythology.’ Lambinus compares Plato’s interpreta-
tion Tim. 22 c: ‘Now this has the torm ot a myth, but really signi·
fies a declination ot the bodies moving around the earth and in the
heavens, anda great conflagration ol things upon the earth recurring
at long intervals of time3 when this happens, those who live upon the
mountains and in dry and lofty places are more liable to destruction
