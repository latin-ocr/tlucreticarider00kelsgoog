deaden or put away the dread of death. Epicurus taught that the

needs ol nature are easily satisfied, and hence moderate means and

simplicity of lite are desirable. See 2, 14 etseq. 65. contemptus:

in a passive sense, a ‘being slighted'3 ‘scorn' 66. videntur:

passive. 67. cunctarier: seen. to 1, cop-ante: with portas.

68. unde:=aquibus. See n. to 1, 5'6. 69. For the chiasmus see

nto 1, ²²·3· 70. rem: ior rem familiarem, as often in both prose

and verse3 trans, ‘property’ 71. For the alliteration secuto 1,

14· 73. consang.: see n. to 1, 1 debona. Among the later Ro>
mans poisoning was a favorite way of getting rid of obnoxious per·

sons. 78. partim: takes the place ot a subject; trans. as it pars

‘Anat of Melancholy,' 1, 4, 1. 80. humanos: ior lconrines. “Their

soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates

ot death.'’ Ps. 107, 18. 81. The Stoics approved of suicide as an

escape from circumstances which seemed unendurable3 but Epicurus

accepted it as advisable only in extreme cases. For the whole sub·

ject ot suicide, ancient and modern, see Lechy,‘Hist. of European

Morals’; consult index, vol. ii. 82. timorem: i.e., mortis. 83.

hunc: supply timorem-vinc. arnt notwithstanding the ¹fact that

the Epicureans based friendship on utility they gave it a very impor-

tant place in practical lite. Hence the mention of it in this connec-

tion. 84. suadet: difficult to construe with the present reading;

suppose a semicolon before ct, and supply hic referring to timorem.

Munro thinks that after 83 there is a hiatus, which he thus supplies,

tomen, ‘this one,’ ‘anothec’ For suadet Lambinus reads fiendo,

omni puero stultiores stemus, qui in luce timemus ? scdfirlsum est, Lucreti,
non timemus in luce: omnia nobissccimus tenebras. nihil vellemus, nec
quid noceat nec quid expediat. tota vita incursztamus, nec ub leuc resisti·
mus aut circumspectius pedem ponimus.
