stand in its regular piace as first word of the clause. In prose, how·
ever, it often yields its position to an emphatic word. Cf. 345; 4, ·
933. 340. sublima: sublimus was a rare collateral form of sublimis.
Lucr. does not use the latter. On the other hand, sublime is the
common form of the adv.‚ and sublimiter is rare. With the threefold
division of the world cf. 278. 341. multa modis multis: Lucr. is
fond of this expression, the alliteration and parorromasiaof which
seem to have struck his fancy. The Latins in general showed a fond·
ness for placing near together words that sounded alike. Cf. A. 344, g;
G. 6833 H. 563. 343. non . . . priv. carer. etc: ie. on the
principle that a thing cannot be said to be deprived of that which it
never possessed-sollicito: with the derivational meaning (sollus,
cognate with ὅλος, whole, and citus part. of ciere) ‘wholly in motion,’
‘rcstless’ So 3, 73²3 6, 1038 and 1185. 346. solidae: solidus,
Munro observes, is the technical term of our poet for what is “ per-
fectly solid and impenetrable, that is, his first-beginnings; in this sense
no res can be solida.'’ See n. to 2²3· 347. cum: hardly necessary
here, as the simple abl. of characteristic would have fully expressed
the meaning. T rans. ‘endowed with: ‘having' This pleonastie use
of cum is not uneommon. See Roby, 1881; Madvig, 258. 350.
omne: not ‘every’ nor ‘whole’ but ‘throughout’ ‘every part of.’
351. Observe the chiasmns; see n. to 22-23.-fundunt: Lucr. is
fond of this word. Cf. 17 53 Cic. De Sen. 14, 51 suaditsrngem spici

In 253 thc use of cirbdris is avoided by supplying ipsae from preceding

Munro's reading for possent ,· a judicious change. So below 593, 597,

garding the void see Zeller ‘ Prae-Soc. Phil, it, 2183 ‘Stoics‚ Epicu-
reans and Sceptics ’ ch. 17. 360. glomere: the o, short by nature,
is here made long. 361. par est: ‘it is natural! 362. deorsum:
scanned deiursum. The Epicurean view that matter tends downward
by its own weight is explained 2, 184-215. 363. inanis t substan·
tive, dep. on nutura; nutura imwn'r, like tratura aquai, mellis, arn'mi,
etc, is somewhat pleonastic. 364. que: ‘and yct,' mildly adversa·
tive3 a use sometimes found in born prose and verse, more frequently
after a negative. 365. nimirum: ‘beyond doubt,' emphatic.
This is a favorite word of Lucr. in introducing a strong assertion.
35⁸.- est = existit; emphatic by position.
