cornus. 618. lunaque: the queis slightly adversative, ‘and yet!
-mensibusz i.e., every month-spatium: i.e.‚ between the tropic
of Capricorn and the tropic oi Cancer. vedeatur is passive. 619.
cursu: pleonastic, yet adding to the cleamess ot the statement.
621. vel: intensive. 622. Ci. 3, 371 and n. ⁶24· caeli tur·
bine: assumed in the first explanation of the movements of the stars,
51⁰ above. 625. evanescere: dz'citDemocritus. cf. 535.-illius:
caeli turbinis. 628. fervida signa: wrongly explained by Zel-
ler, ‘ Prae-Soc. Phil.' ii. 250, n. 3 as “the signs of the Zodiac in which
the sun is in summer.” They are rather, as Munro observes, those
signs of the Zodiac which are higher, and hence are carried on in
more rapid revolution. 629-31. The nearer the moon's course is
to the earth tho less. able it is to keep up with the swiitermoving
signs above it 635-6. The signs in their swifter revolution come up
to the moon and pass by it (praeterque seruntur). Now they com-
plete their circuit and overtake it again, and so on; the moon in
consequence appears to be travelling faster than they in an oppo-
site direction; it seems to be hastening to meet the signs, when in
reality they are going much laster in the same direction, and continu·
ally overtaking it. 637. aer: the poet has in mind two air·
currents, as indicated by alter in 638: the one blows the sun from the
summer signs to those ol winter; the other blows it irom the winter

signs to those ol summer. Cf. n. to 511 ae'ra. 638. alternis:
see nn. to 1, 524 and 767. 642. fervida signa: here, as the con-

nection shows, the signs ol the Zodiac that the sun visits in the
summer. 644. magnos annos: i.e., the vast periods oi the 9 &Oet
stellar revolutions; see n. to 1, 1029. But cf. Diod. Sic. 2, 46 λέγεται, ‘4'st 3

show the influence oi the Aratea. 646. diversis etc.: ‘with

see n. to 1, 168. Epicurus assigns iour possible causes for the mo·
tions ol the sun and moon, Diog. Laert. 10, 93 ‘The movements of
the sun and moon between the tropics may be due either to the ob
liquity impressed by iate on the heaven at certain epochs, or to the
