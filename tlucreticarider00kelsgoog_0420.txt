in piace ς then a third alr-current causes the revolution of the
heavens by blowing either over the sphere or under; in the last case
the motion is produced just as 'the current of a stream turns a
nachumei-aera: the air-current holds a most important place in
the explanation oi phenomena both celestia] and terrestrial by the
ancients. It was employed by Anaximander to explain the move-
ment ol the heavenly bodies; by AnaximeneS, to account tor the circu·
lar form of their orbits; by Empedocles, to show the reason for the
inclination ot the earth's axis toward the path ot the sun; by Arche·
laus (follower of Anaxagoras) and others to account for the steady
position ol the earth in the world ; by Democritus, Metrodorus and
the Epicureans, to explain the cause oi earthquakes (cf. 6, 535-607).
Cf. also the Stoic doctrine that “all attributes by means ot which one
object is distinguished from another are produced by the existence
of certain air-currents, which emanate from the centre ot an object,
diffuse themselves to its outer limits‚ and having reached the suriace,
return again to the centre to constitute the inward unity; '’ by some,
moreover, air-currents were given no small significance in the expla-
nation oi the soul. In many cases it seems as it the ancient philos·
ophers, when they had come across a great mystery and wished to
heed the dictum expressed in Horace's nec deus rittersit, took refuge
in an air-current, instead of a god, as unseen cause. 514. aeterni:

give this form, which is generally taken as awrong reading or an
equivalent ot immania. It is better explained, however, as derived
from Summanus, the name oi an ancient divinity who was thought
to preside over the nocturnal sky and to wield the lightnings that
appear in the night; there was a temple tor his worship near the
Circus Maximus, and in the pediment ol the temple oi the Capitoline
Jupiter there was a representation of him. Summam'a templa, then,
as Munro interprets‚ refers to the nightly sky ; trans. ‘heaven’s Sum-
manian quartem! 523. sive etc: again Lucr. is using poetic
language, which strictly interpreted would be inconsistent with his
system. The thought is, that the heavenly bodies, gathering to them-
selves matter to repair waste, naturally move whithersoever the atoms
adapted to them are found in greatest abundance; lor to different
