nism oi the universe was the productiori and ongoing oi liie. Whence
its origin? Inaiortuitous combination oi atoms, indeed. Yet was
it not a partui the great system oi law? Uneonsciously, perhaps,
poet-philosopher as he was, Lucretius carne to see in nature a myste-
rious, clusine, but all-pervading principle, almost a personality, that
presided over being. Before the majesty oi this generative power
he paused in awe. For him its range and sweep were sea and earth
and sky, wherever living thing might be. Spring was the glad sea-
son oi its quickening advent, and all nature owned its genial sway
(see l. 21). This principle, all-pervasive, all-persuasive, the poet in·
vokes under the name oi Venus-not as an empty iorm oi words,
nor to get aid irom it as a divine personality, but by rapt contem·
plation oi its power to draw inspiration ior his theme. In all this,
however, with true poetic skill he does not present us with abstrao·
tions. With the address to Venus he interweaves mythologie con·
ceptions that had their centre in her. Thus he addresses heras
‘ancestress of the Romans‚’-a phrase to tickle the ears oi his tellow·
countrymen. He pictures her as bringing the War-god under her
control, and bids her keep him irom the iray3 and touches here and
there reveal to us Venus as goddess ot love. In exalting Venus,
moreover, he pays honor to the Memmii, ot whom she seems to have
been the patron goddess; their coins bear image ot her (see Munm,
‘Lucretius' 3d ed. i. 328). Thus with the poetic spirit decply stirred
within him, the poet has skiltully wrought into combination a grand
philosophie idea and conceptione which would enlist the interest and
sympathetic attention oi his readers, particularly Memmius, to whom
the poem was addressed. This invocation to Venus is translated by
Dryden in a spirited version (Aldine ed. oi Dryden, iii. 145). Itis ’
imitated by Spenser, ‘Faerie Queene,’ Bk. 4, Canto ro, st. 44-47.
