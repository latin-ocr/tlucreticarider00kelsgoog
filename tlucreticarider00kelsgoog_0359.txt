of antiquity. Diog. Laertr (ro, 26) says he leit three hundred vol-
umes, in which ‘there was not a citation from other sources; but the
books were entirely filled with Epicurus’ own sentiments! The style
is said to have been exceedingly careless, bald, harsh, and lull ot repe
titions. There are extant only tour letters, the Maxime, and some
fragments. 12. aurea dicta: the Pythagoreans had golden
verses (χρυσᾶ ἔπη) attributed to their founder ; from them, perhaps,
the expression here was borrowed. 14. vociferari: see n. to 1,
732. 15. naturam rerum: see n. to 1, 21 and 2 y On the spirit
of 14-17 cf. 2, 1-13 and n. to 1,112 ignoratur. Democritus taught
that the cause ol tault is the ignorance ot what is better (Frag. 116
ἃμαρτίης αἰτίη ἦ ἀμαθίῃ τοῦ κρέσσονος); Epicurus held, however,
that happiness is not “directly promoted by knowledge, but only indi·
rectly, in astar as knowledge ministers to practical needs, or clears
away hiudrances to their attainment.” ιδ. moenia mundi: see

18. divum: see n. to 1, 1.—sedesq. quietae: Epicurus pictured
the gods as dwelling in the spaces ol the universe between the worlds,
ever blessed and urivexed by any pain or trouble, never interiering
with the course of nature, and utterly regardless ol mankind. Ten·
nyson well brings out the spirit of this passage, ‘Lucretius ’ : -

“The Gods, who haunt
The lucid interspace ol world and world,
Where never creeps a cloud, or moves awind,
Nor ever falls the least white star of snow,
Nor ever lowest roll of thunder means,
Nor sound ol human sorrow mounts to mar
'l'heir sacred, everlasting calm 1’'
