Nor can airer water or earth be taken as the primitive matter.
705-711.

707, principium: see n. on r, 55 primordia-aera: the acc. of
ae'r generally has the Greek form, but ae'rein is found a few times;
so the acc. oi aether is aethera, rarely aetherem. Anaximenes and
Diogenes oi Apollonia were the two principal philosophers who
taught that air is the single primal element. For iull discussion, with
citations from original authorities, see Zeller, ‘Prae-Soc Phil.’ vol. i.
708. umorem: that water is the ultimate matter was the teaching oi
Thales and Hippo. See Zeller ut sup, or Ritter, ‘Hist oi Anc. Phil’
vol. i. 709. terram: Aristotle (Met. 1, 8-a chapter in which the
doctrine of a single material cause is ably criticised) states that none
oi the philosophers took earth alone to be the primal substrate; but
this view has been sometimes attributed to the poet Pherecydes, and
even to Xenophanes. See Zeller, ut sup. i. 567-8. 710. vertier :=

2. Nor is matter made up of two or four primal

elements combined. 712-829.

713. aera iun. ete: no philosopher oi prominence took either air
and fire, or water and earth as the irue primitive elements; but the
former view is assigned to Oenopides oi Chius, the latter sometimes
erroneously to Xenophanes; see rei. on 708. 715. anima: ior

est arrianum· but this use of an. is rare in prose-imbri: poet. for
aqua. The abl. more often ends in e. 716, Empedocles: one oi
the most important of the prae-Socratic philosophers, b. at Agrigen-
tum probably in the first decade oi the fifth cent. ree. ln his lifetime
he was regarded not merely as a philosopher but also as aseer and
prophet, and seems to have welcomed the veneration oi the masses,
who loohed on him with deepest awe. He taught that there are four
primal elements, air, fire, water, and earth, but to the material causes
he added two quasi-spiritual ones, love and strife (see n. on 31).
These agencies alternately acting upon the four kinds of matter cause
combination and dissolution. At first, through the influence of love,
there was perfect union oi the elements. Then striie gradually brought
about a complete separation. uut by love a partial combination was
