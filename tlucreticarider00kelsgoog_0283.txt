later in Latin superseded by··0rum. See Roby, ‘Latin Grammar,'

between the different forms was perhaps governed hythe mette.-
voluptas: Venus as goddess ol love could with propriety be called
honainum divomque uoluptas; for the ancient mythology pictured the
gods with the same joys and passions as men. See the striking'pas'
sage in Cic. N. D. 1, 16, 42. cf. 6, 94 requies hominum diuumque
voluptas, where Calliope is invoked. 2. alma: ‘increasegiving'
The gliding movement oi the verse well suits the sense.

Venus: the Epicureans believed not at all in the influence ol the
Divine over the affairs oi men. Why, then, does Lucretius begin his
poem with an invocation to Venus? The question is not an easy one
to answer. It was the custom of the poets to prelace any important
work with an address to the gods or some particular divinity for
inspiration. Prose writers, too, sometimes followed their example.
Varro opens the ‘De Re Rustica' with a labored prayer to the gods
ol the farmer. Whatever may have been the motive of such invo-
cations at first, after the decline ol the old religion in Greece and
Rome to educated readers and hearers they no longer suggested
any thought ol the real presence ol the Divine; they lurnished merely
an occasion for the dignified display of a bit ot literary linery. Hence
the spiritless invocation of Ovid at the beginning ol the Metamor-
phoses; instances of the like, with many otherS, some graceful and
, some dull, may be found in the writings of his contemporaries and
the poets ol the decline. Oi similar character is Lucretius’ address
to Calliope, quoted above. But while Lucretius in thus opening his
poem was conforming to the example ot the poets from Homer to
Ennius, with him it was not a matter oi display or trifling. These
lines breathe an intense eamestness. Filled with bright images, they
hurry the thought along with resistless force. What, then, the secret
oi their power?

Lucretius conceived oi the world as under the reign ol law (see
n. to 1, 586). Not chance, but fixed orden—inconsistent as this
may appear by the side of his doctrine ol the atom, — seemed to him
the key to the mysteries oi the operations oi nature. To him, as
to thinking men of all ages, the strangest thing in all the mecha·
