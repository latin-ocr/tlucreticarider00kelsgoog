747 et seq. According to the view ol Lucr, there is no qualitative or
essential difference between the mind and soul ol animals and the
mind and soul oi man. This, in sact, is a common tenet of believers
in metempsychosis, materialists of all ages, and oi evolutionists with
materialistic tendencies. It was, perhaps most fully uniolded by the
Freuch rationalists ol the latter part oi the last century; but Haeckel
and those who share his iorm oi the Doctrine ol Descent insist upon
it quite as strenuously as they. ‘⁶ If, as is usually done, we divide the
different emotions ol the soul into three principa] groups,- sensa-
tion, will, and thought-we shall find in regard to every one oi them
that the most highly developed birds and mammals are on a level
with the lowest human beingS, or even decidedly surpass them.''
Haeckel, ‘ Nat. Histoi Creatiou,’ ii. 3643 cl. the rest of the chapter.
The proof, however, is as conspicuously lacking as in the time oi
Lucr. Consult Bowen‚ ‘ Gleanings from a Literary Life: pp. 328-3503
