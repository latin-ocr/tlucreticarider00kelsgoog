1. Atoms‚ of which matter is made up, are solid,
without void. 483·527·

T hat tliere is anything absolutely solid is not known from the senser,
but through reason. 48 3- 502.

483 etseq. That these lines embody the view oi Democritus is
apparent from Diog. Laert. 9, 44. The thought is exactly that ot
Epicurus id. 10, 24, 40·4¹² ‘Oi bodies some, indeed, are combina-
tions, others are (the elements) out ot which the combinatione have
been made. The latter now are indivisible (tirone) and unchange-

· able; else indeed all things would be reduced to non-existence. But
of their own power in the dissolution oi the combinations they sur·
vive, because in their nature they are iuli, and thus show no aspectos
weakness, nor any mode in which they can be destroyed. Therefore‚
oi necessity the first principles oi things are indivisible bodies! Cf.
the statement ot Sir Isaac Newton: “It seems probable that God ⁸
in the beginning formed matter in solid masses, hard, impenetrable‚
moveable particles ot such size, figures, and with such other proper·
ties and in such proportions to s‘pace, as most conduced to the end
ior which he formed them; and that these primitive particles, being
solid, are incomparably harder than any porous body compounded
oi them, - even so very hard as never to wear or to break in pieces.’'
See Lange, ‘Hist oi Materialism,’ section 3, ch. 35 ‘Popular Science
Monthly‚’ 1881, p. 837. Ct. also Herbert Spencer‚ ‘Prin oi Psychol·
ogy,' 3d Am. edit. i. 155: “There is reason to suspect that the so
called simple substances are themselves compound3 and that there is
but one ultimate torm ot matter, out ot which the successively more
complex forms ot matter are built up. By the different grouping ot
unite, and by the combinatione oi the unlike groups each with its own
kind aud each with other kinds, it is supposed that there have been
produced the kinds oi matter we call elementary; just as, by further
composition simultaneously carried on, these produce further varie·
ties and complexities.” See also Zeller, ‘ Prae-Socrat. Phil! ii. 220-1,
228; Tyndall, ‘Fragments of Science,’ 5th edit. p. 475. Consult
