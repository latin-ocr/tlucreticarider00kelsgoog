speaking oi the stars as living things, however, the poet was conform-
ing to the language oi many of his philosophie predecessors and con-
temporaries as well as to that of common life3 for their divine nature
was deeply rooted in ancient thought. Anaximander and Anaximenes
seem to have considered the stars as created gods; the Pythagoreans
believed in their divinity; Plato and Aristotle taught that they are
living, rational beings; and the Stoics thought that they are permeated
with the divine spirit, possessed of souls. 526. eorum: ie, eonem

here is exactly that ol Epicurus, who in explaining natural phenomena
made it his principle to assign several causeS, any one oi which might
be true of this world, and all of which might operate in one or an-
other ot the infinite number oi worlds. Thus he declares that the
motion of the stars may be due to the movement oe the entire heaven ;
or that they may move while the heaven remains stationary, either
from an impulse given them when they were formed and continued by
their heat, or from the attraction of material suitable to their nature,
etc.; see Diog. Laert. ιο, 25, 87 et seq. ; 10, 25, 111-4. Consult

is interesting that recently a Frenchman (A. Blanqui, ‘L'Eternitb par
les Astres, Hypothbse astronomique‚' PariS, 1872) has carried out
again, quite seriously, the idea that everything possible is somewhere
and at some time realized in the universe; and, in lact, has oitcn
been realized, and that too as an inevitable consequence, on the one
hand, oi the absolute infinity of the universe, but on the other of the
finite and everywhere constant number ol the elements whose possible
combinations must also be finite.'’ Cf. Lucr. 2, 480-521.
