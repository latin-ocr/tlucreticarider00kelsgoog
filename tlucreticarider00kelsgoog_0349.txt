side os the universe is evidently not yet reached ‚· is not stupped, it must go
on sorever. Again, ull things we see are bounded oue by autunn- but the
urriuerse there is nothing outside to bound. 9 58-987.

958. Omne etc: ‘the existing universe is bounded in none oi its
dimensions.’ nul. reg. vi.: Munro well explains, ‘take which
ever of the roads through the universe you please, at no point in any
oi them will you reach its bound· Cf. Epicurus in Diog. Laert. 10,
24, 41-2: ‘And moreover the universe is infinite; for that which
is limited has an outside, and the outside is perceived in relation to
something else. So that, not having an outside, it has no boundary;
and, not having a boundary, it must be infinite and not limited! The
Stoics, following Aristotle, taught that the universe is limited‚ but that
outside oi it there is unlimited extent of void space. The question
whether or not the universe is finite was one that aroused sharp cou-
troversy long after Lucretius’ day. Cf. Lucian ‘Ikaromenippus 8 nai
’γὰρ αὖ καὶ αὕτη νεανικὴ αὐτοῖς ἡ μάχη, τοῖς μὲν τέλει τὸ πᾶν περιγρά-
φουσι, τοῖς δὲ ἀτελὲς τοῦτο εἶναι ὑπολαμβάνουσιν. For the view of
a modern materialist, cf. Haeckel, ‘Nat Hist. of Creation,’ ch. 13
(i. p. 324) z ‘⁴ The universe is unlimited and immensurable in both space
and time. Nor can we imagine a beginning or end to the uninter-
rupted and eternal motion in which all particles oi the universe are
always engaged. . . . The great laws of the corzseruute'on (Μανία and
the conseruau'on of matter, the foundations oi our whole conception
of motion, admit of no other supposition. The universe, sofar as it
is cognizable to human capability, appears as a connected chain oi
material phenomena of motion, necessitating a continual change oi
forms. Every form, as the temporary result oi a multiplicity of phe-
nomena οἱ motion, is as such perishable and oi limited duration. But,
in the continual change of forms, matter and the motion inseparable
from it romain eternal and indestructible.'' Cf. nn. on 150 and 1021.
