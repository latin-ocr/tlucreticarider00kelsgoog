lii INTRODUCTION

In his collocation of words Lucretius sometimes shows a
striving after effect. The fondness for alliteration and asso-
nance, so common among the early Latin writers, is displayed in
no small degree. Yet the ear does not sate with the results of
it, often his arrangements of words, especially in the adaptation
ot verse-movement to sense, are peculiar and highly effective.
The versification of Lucretius is a vast improvement upon that
of Ennius in regularity and ease os movement. There is a ten·
dency toward the monotonous3 but it is always a monotony
suggestive rather oi majestic flow than insipid rippling. lts
rhythm is on the whole more pleasant to the ear than that oi
Horace’s hexameters, though it lacks the subtle variety and
artistic finish of Vergil’s. As a philosopher Lucretius was
surpassed by 'no Roman in the power of grasping a system of
thought, or in cogency of reasoning; as a poet he was un·
equalled by any Roman in originality and power of expression.
The De Rerum Natura is by many regarded, not unjustly, as
the greatest didactic poem ol all literature.
