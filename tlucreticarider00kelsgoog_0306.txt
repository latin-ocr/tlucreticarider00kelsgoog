sous in which all pruriente eremum. 174-183.

174. calore = aestate,· so frigm is sometimes used for hiemps, as
Verg. Ecl. 5, 70 oute frocum si frepus erit. Thus in Greek θάλπος is found
ior θέρος, ψῦχος for χειμών. 175. fundi: see n. to 351. 178. tem·
pestates: here = ὧραι, ‘the due seasons.’ Tempestas in the singular
