particularly stallo, ⁸ Concepts and Theories oi Modern Physics‚’ ch. 4.
Homogeneity ol matter, it is worth while to remark, is not a neces·
sary postulate oi materialistic evolution. See Elam, ‘Winds oi Doc-
πίῃς,1 p. 35. 484. concilio: a technical term in Lucr. ior the
‘union' or ‘combination’ oi atoms. The subject oi atoms is more
fully discussed 2, 80-5803 that oi the combination oi atonis, 2, 581-
1174. 486. stinguere :=exttngnere. The simple verb is rarely
used except by L'ucr„ perhaps not by any other writer except Cicero
in the Aratea. 487. etsi: as in 120, where see n. 491. vapore:
‘heat ’ς the word in classical Latin never corresponds to our ‘vapor.'
495. utrumque: i.e. calorem frigusque. 501· semina ete: see n.
on 55 primordia.

Matter and void have nothing in common ; where one is, the other is
not,· in atonis there is ne void. 503-527. “

506. sibi: added ior emphasis. Munro compares the English ex·
pression ‘in and for itsell.’—puram: ‘unmixed' 508. ea: ed is
often explained as an abl. with parte or some such word understood.
While such was doubtless the original use, in cases like this it should
¹ be considered an adu-qua por. cumq.: tmesis. 511-7. In
things (not atoms) there is void, which could not be unless the bound·
ing first beginnings were solid and impenetrable. 520. vocaret:
old form ior vacaret, as the early votivos, vacuos ior vacivus, vacuus.
523. omne quod est: i.e.‚ ‘the universe.'-constaret:=esset‚·
vacuum and e'uane are oi course adj. 524. alternis: old abl. pl.
used as adv.; common in Lucr. but rare elsewhere; ‘in alternate
layers’ 525. plenum ε--τὸ nappis ‘the furi: as distinguished from
veicuum rh κενόν ‘the empty.’ Plenum is a term applied to matter from
its extension, eorpus irom its power oi resistance. ct. n. to 55, where
the words ior the ultimate forms of matter are discussed. —naviterr
the original force oi this word was ‘diligently'; then, as one is wholly
intent upon the business in hand, ‘wholly,' ‘entirely,’ the meaning
here. As subject oi extat (καί) supply omne quod est.

2. Atoms are indestructible and eternal. 528-634.

The atoms‚ being without void, are impenetrahle ; and hence can be
affleted neither hy blozossrom without, nor hy arrything permeating within
(528-539). Is it were not thus, long ago all things had been reduced to
nothing ( 5405 50).
