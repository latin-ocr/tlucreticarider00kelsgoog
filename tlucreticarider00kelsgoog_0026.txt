LUCRETIUS As A PHILOSOPHER xix

strate was water3 Anaximenes, air; Anaximander, an infinite,
indefinite substance. The Pythagoreans grasped at the idea oi
the essential difference between spirit and matter, but yet were
not able in their thinking to purge matter of psychica] qualities;
hence their doctrine oi the world-soul. The Eleatics recognized
more clearly than they the antagonism between matter and
spirit, but relegated the former to the domain of pure phenom-

ena, denying the reality oi change and making being and
thought identical; to them the universe was one vast, change-
less thought. Heraclitus¹ assumed fire as the fundamental
matter, and attributed to it psychical properties, taking it as both
cause and symbol of change, the reality of which he maintained
in opposition to the Eleatic doctrine. The Atomists rank with
Empedocles² and Anaxagoras⁸ as the first who made complete
severance of the physical and the psychical, -matter and mov-
ing cause ; and who, in order to explain changes and the on-going
of the universe, assumed the operation of some principle entirely
outside oi matter and above it. Empedocles taught that there

are four ultimate forms of matter, or elements; and two influ- ·

ences, or directing forces,4 acting upon them. Anaxagoras as-
sumed an indefinite number oi primitive substances, infinitely
divisible, and a rational iorce as final cause. Midway between
the two carne the Atomists, who made an advance upon Empe·
docles in positinga single ultimate matter, made up of indivisible
particles, the different shapes of which explained the possibility
oi all combinations; but they adopted a less philosophie con-
ception oi moving cause than Anaxagoras, appealing to the
inadequate law oi necessity.

The Atomists were two, Leucippus and Democritus. Oi the
former little is known save that he iurnished the basis oi the
theory oi the latter. Democritus⁵ was born about 460 Β. c. Ac·
cording to him there is matter, or the “iull; '’ and there is
“void” or space devoid oi matter. The latter must be consid-
