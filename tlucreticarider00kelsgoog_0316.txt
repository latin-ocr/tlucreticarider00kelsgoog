and the Stoics combated the notion that void is necessary ior motion.

each proposition involves a contradiction; aret...1aut is used
with propositions mutually exclusive. The Epicureans admitted the
reality oi motion and the existence oi void ; Melissus took the other
horn oi the dilemma and, denying the existence oi void, sought to show
therefrom the impossibility oi motion. His reasoning is interesting.
“Every movement presupposes a void; that which can receive
another into itseli is void; that which cannot receive another is iull;
that which moves can do so only in the void. But the void would
be non-existent, and the nonexistent does not exist. Consequently
there is no void, therefore no motion.'’ See Zeller, ‘Prae-Socratic
Philosophy,’ i. 635. As regards the soundness oi the dilemma the
philosophers oi today ure not much more able to pronounee with
certainty than in the time oi Epicurus, ior each oi the statements
must be treated as an induction; and in the present limited range oi
scientific knowledge, when even the atom oi which rnen speak with
so much positiveness rests on an hypothesis, certainty regarding them
is unattainable. 383. initum2=initium; so also 2, 269 initum
