374 LUCRETIUS [v. 1028-

roundings. . . . Later, in each nation particular terms were invented
and put into usage by authority, that relations might be less ambigu-
ous and speech more concise. The wise, too, bringing into experience
things not apprehended by the senses made sodnds to express them;
and these terms came into use partly of necessity in the case of men
desiring to express the same ideas, partly through those who follow·
ing reason employed them in the same sense! Most writers on the
origin of Language agree with Lucr. in putting it after the first steps
01 progress. Cf. Haeckel, ‘Nat¹ Hist. of Creation‚' 11. 300: “The
origin of articulate language must be looked upon as only a later, and
the most important, stage 111 the process of the development of Man.”
The question whether language was in its origin natural or conven-
tional was much discussed in antiquity; cf. Aul. Gel. 10, 4. Most
of the philosophers held the view 01 Luca, which is essentially that
most widely adopted to-day, having as its champions Darwin (⁴ Descent
01 Man,’ i. 52-60), as well as many philologists. 10²9· expressit

1053. quid facto: an expression rare outside of eomedy. For the

impels to the use and development 01 11. Having the capacity to
speak, man learned to speak. 1062. apertis: cf. n. to 1, 9¹5·
1063 etseq. Darwin in discussing the natural origin of language
uses the same illustration 101 the same purpose as Lucr.; ‘Descent
of Man,’ 1. 52: “Although barlring is a new art, no doubt the wild
species, the parents of the dog, expressed their feelings by 01105 01
various kinds. With the domesticated dog we have the bark 01 eager-
ness, as in the chase; that 01 anger; the yelping or howling bark 01
despair, as when shut up; that 01 joy, as when starting on a vvalk
with his master3 and the very distinct one 01 demand or supplication,
as when wishing for a door or window to be opened.'' 1066. et:
