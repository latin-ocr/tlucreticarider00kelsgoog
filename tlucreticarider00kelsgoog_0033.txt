(iii.) Ericununmsu ns sar roruu nr Lucnurrus.

Lucretius followed Epicurus as unerring guide.¹ In his poem,
however, he did not attempt to expound the whole Epicu·
rean philosophy. Having in viewa definite aim,2 he set forth
only those portions ol Epicurus’ teachings necessary to the
attainment ol it. He treats in detail only the views on nature,
striving by his theory of the universe and the development of
civilization⁸ to banish all sear oi the gods, and by his prooi of
the mortality of the soul to dispel the dread oi death. Inter·
spersed with his physical doctrines, however, there are many
ethical reflections⁴ that give an insight into his views of lite and
duty. Ii the lost work oi Epicurus ‘On Nature '⁵ were extant,
doubtless Lucretius' poem throughout would be iound to bear a
close resemblance to it. Whatever the poet teaches may be
accepted as also the doctrine oi his maste13 only when carried
away with poetic inspiration does he step out ot the beaten
track of the school to which he belonged.l Lucretius’ exposi-

tion may be conveniently- treated under four headS, -theory oi
knowledge, theory ot the universe, theory oi organic life, view
of man.l

1. Lucretius' Theory oi Knowledge.

Knowledge of things is gained through the senses. These
never err; upon them depends all reasoning.⁸ From the suriace
of things films of matter, the idois or images, are continually
thrown off. They are exceedingly thin, ol exactly the same
