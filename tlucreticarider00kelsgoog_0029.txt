the body but ot the soul. Wisdom brings seli-mastery; without

With Socrates came a change in the trend of Greek thought.
Cicero says oi him that ‘he called philosophy down from heaven,

now directed not so much to the problem of the universe as to
that of man, to settling the vexed questions oi human lii . But
Socrates was too broad a man to be iully comprehended by his
generation. Most of the schools that owed their originative
impulse to his teachings reflected these only partially and im-
perfectly. Two in particular, the Cynic and the Cyrenaic‚
grasped each but a single phase of doctrine, and made it alone
the basis oi a system of morals; hence were developed two
ethical theories diametrically opposed to each other. Socrates
taught the intimate relation between virtue and happiness. He
enjoined the life of virtue, which he made to consist in actions
directed solely by reason under all circumstances; but he clearly
conceived as an aim to this only the happiness resulting there·
from. Antisthenes and the Cynics expanded the virtue-aspect
os the teaching, and laid down a harsh rule of actions, choking
