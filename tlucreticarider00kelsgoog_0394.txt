925-7. Death is less tous than sleep, ii there can be a less than
nothing. The Epicureans thought that in sleep a portion oi the soul
leit the body. Literature is tull oi passages based upon the likeness
of death to sleep. The conception of sleep, as the brother oi death,
goes back as far as Homer3 see Il. 16, 682; Shelley, ‘Queen Mab,’
rst stanza; Lessing, ‘How the Ancients represented Death! Cf.
Cic. De Sen. 22, 80 iam uero uadetis nihil esse morti tam simile quom
somnum; Id. Tusc. Disp. 1, 38, 92 quadraret autem, qui ne sentit qui-
dem? habes somnum imaginem mortis eamque cotidie induis, et dubitas
quin sensus in morte nullus sit, eum in sa'us simulacro videas esse nullum
sennem? Both Lucretius and Cicero seem to have been thinking of
the heavy, dreamiess sleep, and were not troubled with the apprehen·
sions that vexed Hamiet :-

“To die,-to sleep:-
To sleep Ι perchance, to dream ε ay, there ’s the rub ;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled ott this mortal coil,
Must give us pause.’¹

Cf. the ‘Systdme de la Nature,’ part 1, ch 13: “But does not a
proiound sleep help to give him a true idea oi this nothing? Does
not that deprive him oi everythingi Does it not appear to annihilato

the universe to him, and him to the universe? Is death anything
more more than a proiound, a permanent sleep?”

(6) What could we say, saue that her cause is just, tf Nature should
thus address ees: ‘Why, 0 mortal, grieue that thou meost die'? If o glad

life hos been thy lot, why not depart content? is lise is lrhsome, why not
end it? Shouldst thou, ueuer die there is nothing rseao in storesor thee.'

If on old man should mourn ot death, would she not rightly ehtde? -
‘Hence with thy teors, trister! Thou host let thy lise slip away afoilure,
the fitult is thine own ,· make raom for others! T o none r's life ga'oen ln

perpensity. As the past was before our birth, so shall the future be aster
