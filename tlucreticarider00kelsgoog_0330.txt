reasoning in 615—622 was borrowed by the Epicureans from the
Eleatics. Granted that matter is infinitely divisible‚ the least thing
as well as the greatest will be made up oi an infinite number ol parts;
thus there will be no difference between them, because infinities are
equal. Exactly the same was the view of the Indian materialist
Kanada, who taught that if matter were infinitely divisible a grain
of sand would be “equal to a mountain, both being infinite.'' See
Fleming, ‘Vocab. oi Phil! art. A tom. The argument is aparalogism,
as has olten been shown. It assumes that anything which can be
divided into an infinite number of parts is infinite, and that all infini-
ties are equal. We conceive oi space, ior example, as infinitely
divisible; hence any measure in space, as a mile, an inch, is inli-
nitely divisible; but the mile and the inch are not therefore equal
divisions of space. 625. ea: refers to the parts oi the atoms; so
quae in 626. 627. illa: i.e., the atoms: quoque, ie. as well as the
inseparable parts oi which atoms are made up. 632. possunt:
supply hobam ‘cannot have those properties which' etc. The argu·
ment in 628-634 must be carefully distinguished from that of Demo·
critus horrowed from Zeno, “that an absolute division would leave
no magnitude remaining, and therefore nothing at all.'’ See Zeller,
‘Prae-Soc. Phil! ii. 219. In illustration of our poet’s position
Munro quotes Maxwell, ‘Theory of Heat,' p. 285: “We do not assert
that there is an absolute limit to the divisibility of matter; what we
assert is that aiter we have divided a body into a certain finite num·
ber of constituent parts called molecules, then any further division of
these molecules will deprive them oi the properties which give rise
to the phenomena observed in the substancess’ On the value oi the
argument see Stallo, ‘Concepts and Theories ol Mod. Phys! ch. 7.
