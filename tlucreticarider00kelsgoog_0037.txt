xxx INTRODUCTION

fuel at fixed times.¹ Thunder is produced by the collision oi
clouds, or by the bursting of' clouds from pent-up wind, or the
blowing of the wind violently through them, or the confllct os
inharmonious elements in them. Flashes oi lightning are seen
when the clouds ior some reason have struck forth seeds of fire.
Thunderbolts are forged hythe wind compressing the clouds,
and forcing the elements oi heat into a fiery mass; this falls
with so great violence partly because oi the impulse given it by
the condensed cloud driving it forth, partly by reason of its own
weight and the exceeding fineness ot the particles oi which it is
composed.² Water·spouts are made by the confinement of wind
in a cloud, when the power os the blast‚ not being sufficient to
burst it, forces it down to the surface of sea or land.i Volca-
noes are formed when the wind, imprisoned in vast earth-caverns‚
by its pressure melts portions ol rock, and forces forth the mol·

ten mass, together with much sand brought in its way by under-
ground channels from the sea.⁴ The violence oi these winds,

and sometimes the falling in oi the cavern rools, are causes of
earthqualres.⁵ The alternate warmth and coolness in some
wells and hot springs may be explained by the shilting of parti-
cles ol heat from earth to water, or irom water to earth, with the
alternate contraction and expansion of the earth by day and by
night or at different seasons.⁶ The power of the magnet results
from this: that the atoms in it by their blows continually force
the air away [rom it on every side3 into the vacuum thus pro·
duced rush all other bodies not ior some reason held back!
Disease and pestilence have their origin in the tainting of the
air by elements banetul to lif .⁸ ln this way purely natural
causes can be assigned ior everything that happens. If it were
not for the groundless fears that burden the souls oi men there
would be no need oi studying the processes ol nature.⁹
