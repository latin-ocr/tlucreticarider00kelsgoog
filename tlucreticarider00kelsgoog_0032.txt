LUCRETIUS As A PHILOSOPHER xxv

his hands both underwent expansion, and were somewhat modi·
fied. He saw that if atoms are assumed to be of an infinite

number of shapes, some may be infinitely large, which would be .

inconsistent with the belief that the atoms are invisible. He
held, therefore, that the shapes oi atoms are finite in number,
but that the atoms of each form are numberless. Observing,
moreover, thatin a vacuum all bodies must fall equally fast
in parallel lines, he rejected the teaching that in the void the
heavier atoms falling strike the lighter3 he supposed that the
smaller atoms swerve a little from a straight downward course,
and that thus by mutual entanglement a world nucleus is formed.¹
The cause of the swerving to one side he assigned not to the
operation os the law of necessity, but to a sort of inherent
power, an originative impulse of motion in the atoms them-
selves3 in this he found the origin of the power oi free move-
ment, and the source of the sreedom ol the human will.
Epicurus, moreover, believed in gods; but he denied them all
concern in the changes ol things.² In ethics he differed from ἵ
the Cyrenaics regarding the nature of happiness. He did not
limit it to a continuanc‘e or succession of pleasurable sensatious‚
but found it also in perfect freedom of the body from pain and
the soul from care or anxiety. He thus recognized a negative
as well as positive side of happiness. He enlarged upon the
Cyrenaics' doctrine of pleasure as the supreme good, and empha-
sized as much as they the rational pursuit of it. The sage will
. be a carelul reckoner ol paius and pleasures. All actions in
which the pains are going to predominate he will reirain irom3
all which involve the more pleasure he will engage in. The
remaining doctrines ol Epicurus may be best considered in
discussing the presentation of his philosophy by Lucretius.
