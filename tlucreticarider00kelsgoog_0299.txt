117· Ennius: Q. Ennius (b. 239 ac. at Rudiae in Calabria, d. 169)
was “in letters what Scipio was in action, the most vital representa·
tive of his epoeh. It was to him, not to Naeviusor Plautus, that the
Romans lookcd as the father ol their literature.” Of hiswritings only
fragments remain. The most important was the Annales, the first great
Latin epic in hexameter verse, celebrating the achievements oi the
Roman people from Aeneas down to the poet’s own time. Lucr.
looked to Ennius as his master in verse, aud shows in many passages
traces of his influence. Vergil likewise and others found in Ennius,

fitness transferred and imitated. Ennius was a Pythagoream He

merus, though there is reference also to the Homeric flow oi his epie
