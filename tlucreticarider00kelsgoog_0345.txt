863. ossa: i.e., corpora parva, or corpuscula, assim.- partis: i.e.,
particulas. 864. liquor: for liquidus (cibus). 865. alienigenis:
‘different in kind,' ‘foreign in kind,’ the opposite, as Mnnro remarks,
to δμοιομερής. The argument is, that food does not consist ol minute
particles of like nature with itself, as the doctrine of Anax. requires,
but of particles of blood, bone, etc, things foreign to it in kind. And
likewise the earth is composed not of minute portions of earth, but
of particles that go to make up all the things that grow out of it. So
again in wood flant-particles lurk. 868. terris: the pl. brings out
the idea of ⁴ parts’ or ‘portions of earth ’; ‘earths' 870. transfere·
imper. for protasis of cond. sentence, ‘apply' (ie. if you apply) the
same reasoning. 873-4 These lines, as they stand, are meaning·
less. Lachmann reads 874

ex alienigenis, quae alienigenis oriuntur,

which is not at all clear; Munro supposes that after 873 there is
a break, which he thus bridges over, simply adding lais to 874 as it
stands in the iuss:

ex alienigenis quae tellure exoriuntur.
sic itidem quae ligna emittunt corpora, aluntur
ex alienigenis, quae lignis his oriuntur.

This, at least, makes good sense and completes the argument.

But Anaxagoras assumes that while in things all sorts eff nebstances
ore mingled, only that becomes apparent aff which tlte partiales ore most
numerous and conspicuous; the others, as it were, lie ln'd. Quite wrong.
For, on tais suppositione, when things are crnslnd, minute partiales os
difflrem substances oughl to appear. 87 5-896.

875. ⁸ Here some slight opportunity is given for evasion’ —tenviss
a dissyllable, as often in poetry. 878. plurima: supply corpora
parvo or corpuscula. 881. conveniebat: trans. as if snbj.; so 884
decebat. A. 311, c; G. 246, Rem. 1; Η. 476, 4. 883. aliquid: sup-
ply eorum. 885. lapidi: abl. 886. latices: i.e., ‘⁴ the waters
that the sheep drink.'’ 887. Lachmann, followed by Munro, thus
explains the constr.: dulces guttas mittere (tales) qzsali oues sunt ubere
lactis,· “ ubere is briefiy said for sapore uberis.” 892. praefr.
forent: observe the snbj, while above in 882 franguntur and 885
