tere: ‘p'ut torth'3 a favorite word of our poet in this connection. Cf.
1, 8. 194 secreta cibo: secernere is often followed by the abl. with
a, ab ; sometimes by the abl. with ex ,· rarely and only in poetry by the
simple abl. as here and in Hor. Od. 1, 1, 32 secernunt populo. Lucr.
has the gen. of separation in 2, 843 secreta teporis etc. For the thought

199. denique: ‘again' This word is used by Lucr. ior the most
part not to introduce the last argument of a series, or a generalization‚
but simply to present a new point. This use is more akin to the origi·
