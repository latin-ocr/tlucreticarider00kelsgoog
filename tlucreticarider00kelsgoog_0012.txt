from Martha's ‘Le Poime de Lucrece,’ and especially
from Sellar's scholarly and appreciative discussion ot
Lucretius in the ‘Roman Poets oi the Republic.’ Other
writings that have been found of use are cited in the

criticisms‚ and to several Faculties for the loan from
university libraries oi old editions oi the poem, as well
- as other rare books bearing upon the subject
