omnipotens is used in a similar manner. 400. magnanimum:
Ovid applies this epithet to Phaethon, Met. 2, 111. His prolix but
spirited account of Phaethon (Met. 2, 1-400) in several places shows

also that it had a beginning; he now proceeds to show of what sort
that beginning was 3 how, from a cloud of falling atoms clashing in
space, the present order ot things has corne about and continues in
