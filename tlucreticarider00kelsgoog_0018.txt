LUCRETIUS AS A MAN xi

poem reveals a grasp of thought. unity os plan, and power of
consecutive reasoning, such as to preclude the belief that it
was composed ‘in lucid intervals.' Still, the last books are of
· unequal spirit and finish. Though abounding in magnificent
passages, unexcelled in the first three books, they evince a lack
of clearness in analysis that may be due to a waning power of
coordination.1 ln a few places the lines seem to bave been
hastily composed, and jotted down to bridge over till something
better could be written. lt appears certain from the realistic
power of several passages that the poet was tormented by horrid
dreams and visions in sleep and sickness ;² these may well have
marked the incipient stages of some mental disorder. There is
no indication that Lucretius attempted any other work. luto
this one poem all the fervid energy of an earnest iiie was thrown.
It may be that his powers, long wrought up to the highest ten·
sion, aster a few premonitions suddenly gave way; that, plunged
into despair at the loss of mental grasp and the inability to
finish his work, following the example of one whom he looked
upon as guide and master,8 he put an end to a life no longer
happy or useful. Perhaps, as Sellar suggests, he “may have
himself attributed what was either a disorder of his own con·
stitution‚ or the result oia prolonged overstrain of mind, to
the effects of some powerful drug taken in ignorance.'' The
cold satire with which he treats the passion of love may have
given rise to the tradition that his reason was wrecked by a
philter given him to stir the sluggish affectione* In a dis-
torted way the story probably reflects some tragic lact of the
poet’s life.⁵
