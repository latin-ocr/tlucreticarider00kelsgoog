LUCRETIUS AS A PHILOSOPHER xvii

A great impulse was given to education, especially that partui
it concemed with the training of the orator. With progressive
enligbtenment the old religion lost its hold on the higher classes.
'Something was needed to take its place as a guide to duty.
Shaking off the shackles of a confused and corrupting poly-
theism, the best minds oi Rome awoke to a suh realization of
the mysteries of existence, and sought a theory oi things in

which they could find rest. The Greek philosophy seemed to
meet all needs. To it the Romans turned, partly indeed as
fitting fora public career by training the mind and broadening
the culture, but also as iumishing a rational explanation oi the
universe, and arule oi life in the place of discarded superstitious.
The Greeks loved speculation sor its own sake; the Romans
only ior its practical bearing. The Greeks made systems; the
Romans put thern to the test by living them out in daily life.
From the time of Socrates the tendency of the Greek philoso-
phy had been to become more and more ethical and practical;
among the Romans this tendency was intensified because of the
trend of the national character. It was the mission oi the
Greeks to originate a philosophy; oi the RomanS, to find ior the
world the true value oi this as a means of putting man in har-
mony with his environment. Knowledge was of course con-
fined to the higher classes. lt was only by the precepts and
the examples oi the lives os these that philosophy had influence
upon the masses. Ι

In Lucretius’ time all the principal Greek schools were repre-
sented at Rome. There were only iour of special prominence,
the Stoic, the Peripatetic, the N ew Academic, and the Epicu·
rean. The Stoic doctrine, stom the significance it gave to natu-
ral law, and from its rigid code of duty, was especially adapted
to the Roman character, and had the greatest following. The
Peripatetic differed from the Stoic mainly in the position that
in comparison with virtue other things are entitled to considera-
tion, while the Stoic held that they are not. The adherents of
the New Academy, accepting probability as the basis oi their

speculation, were eclectic‚ and gleaned irom every source; geu·
