451. permitiali: so two ol the best Mss.; perniciali is the common
reading, adopted also by Lachmann. The meaning is the same in
either case. Permitialis is found only here; but permities ‘ destruc-
tion,’ ‘ ruin,’ ‘decay’ is several times met with. 452. potis: here
not declined; pote, however, is sometimes met with. Either torm
is rare in classical prose, where potest is used instead-seque
greg: tmesis; segregari would not suit the metre. 453. liquor:
the iis here lengthened. 454. Lachmann has shown that this
verse is an interpolation. The dativcs are inconsistent with the pre·
ceding genitives, and the nom. intactus is a barbarism. 457. na·
tura: i.e. rei nasius. Observe the elegant and forcible arrangement
oi words. 459: cstz=existit “Here too,” Munro remarks,
“Lucr. is combating Chrysippus and the Porch, who taught that
time was not only ἀσώματον, but also like void καθ’ οὖτά τι νοούμενον

danda, as often. 462-3. The doctrine that time cannot be known
apart from motion and rest was worked out ογ Aristotle. Lucr. is in
error in denying utterly its objective existence, as he does 459. We
reach our conceptione of time and space only through experience ;
indeed experience is apprehended by us only in terms‚ as it were, of
time and space; but that there is something outside of ourselves cor·
responding to these conceptione, few will deny. Lucretius’ error
originates in the notion of ‘existence’ held by the Epicureans, Elea·
