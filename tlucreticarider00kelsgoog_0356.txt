best MS. leaves a space here 101 eight lines. The lost vss. are sup
posed to have come at the top of p. 46 01 the original tus. A part
01 the leaf having p. 45 on one side and p. 46 on the other was tom
away; thus vss. 1093-1101 were lost entire, being on a left-hand page,
and written nearer the outer edge; while only the ends ol vss. 1068-
107 5, which were on a right-hand page, and nearer the inside, were
torn away. The missing lines have been variously supplied. Munro
bridges over the chasm in his translation: ‘unless from time to time
[nature supplied} food from the earth to each [throughout both, stem
and boughs, their reasons are not only false, but they contradict each
other. Space I have already proved to be infinite; and space being
infinite, matter, as I have said, must also be infinite] lest after the

been lost. He thus supplies its place, making both good sense and
good constr. in a passage otherwise obscure and difficult :-
