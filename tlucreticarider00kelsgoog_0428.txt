explain, on this account become desirous of explaining things that
cannot be known. Perhaps the moon shines by her own light,
perhaps she gets it from the sun, for among us one sees many things
having light of their own, and many shining by reflection. . . . The
appearance of a face in the moon may be due to a transposition of
parts, or to the interposition of some body, or to any other causes of

June, July, and August in Central and Southern Italy winds blow from
the north and northeast with great regularity; they were hence called
etesiae (ἐτησίαι) because of their‘annual recurrence. Cf. Cic. N. D. 2,
