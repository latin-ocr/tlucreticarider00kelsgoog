kastam . . .’ Contorsit. 97& fini: arare torm of the abl. in this
word; probably a survival from an old loc. form. 979. ioras:
‘forth’ ‘torward’ without stopping at all. 983. ‘the room ior
flight' will always prolong the power of flight. Edd. notice that “this
illustration was suggested to Lucr. by the Roman mode oi declaring
war. In the words oi Livy, 1, 32, 12 fieri solitum ut seteizlis hastam . . .
od fines eorum ferret. . . leostom in fines eorum emittebat. You cannot
go outside oi the omne to liing a spear into a neighbor’s bounds.’'
Munro compares a striking illustration of Locke, ‘Essay on the
Human Understanding,’ 2, 13, 21: “I would ask whether, if God
placed a man at the extremity oi corporeal beings, he could not
stretch his hand beyond his body? Ii he could, then he would put
his arm where there was before space without body; and if there he
spread his fingers, there would still be space between them without
body. If he would not stretch out his hand, it must be because ol
some external hindrance. . . . Iwould fain meet with that thinking
man that can in his thoughts set any bounds to space.”

2. Space is infinite. 988-1007.

Is space were not infinite, matter by its own wetglet long ogo would
leave settled in solid mass in tlte lowest part, thus rendering motion
impossible. 988-1007.

991. ponderibus: weight, according to the Epicureans, was one
ot the essential properties ot the atoms.-confluxet: ror confluxer-
set. See nto 233 consumpse. 996—1001. On the eternal down-
ward motion oi the atoms see 2, 80-141 ; cf n. on 1058 sursum,· Epi·
curus in Diog.Laert.1o, 24, 43 and 47; Cic. N. D. 1, 20, 543 see
also Introd. Modern atomists insist on the perpetual movement ot
atoms, but explain it for the most part by the wave theory. See the
quotation from Haeckel n. to 958; ct. Spencer ‘Prin ot Psychology,’
Pt. 5, cb. ro: ‘¹ In the minutest visible fragment oi matter there are
millions oi units vibrating with unimaginable speed.'' . . . In the
ether “each complex molecule of matter oscillating as a whole-nay,
each separate member ot lt independently oscillating—causes respon·
sive movements in adjacent ethereal molecules, and these in remoter
⁴ oneswithout limit ; ” and “molecules oi each kind are specially affected
by molecules oi the same kind existing in the tarthest regions ot
space. Units oi sodium on which the sunlight falls heat in unison
