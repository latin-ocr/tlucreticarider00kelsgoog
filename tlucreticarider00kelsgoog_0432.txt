mal slime,'’as Zeller calls it. St. Augustine accounted for the apparent
spontaneous generation oi minute living things by declaring that at
the beginning oi the world, when God created man and the other ani·
mals, he made also an infinite number oi invisible seeds, which are

⁸ conditions of heat and moisture. 805. tibi: see n. to r, 673.-

The medem advocates oi materialistic evolution have found it diffi-
cult to explain why at the beginning the lowest forms of life were
spontaneously produced from the earth and today similar forms are
not still produced (for there is not a particle of evidence to show that
spontaneous generation is going on at present); and whythose lowest
forms have not all worked up to a higher plane of existence, instead
of showing no essentia] change of type in the vast periods oi time
that have elapsed since remains ot life began to be fossilized in the
rocks. To the first question no one has offered a solution more satis-
factory than that proposed by our poet in these two lines. 829.
