Romans themselves sometimes identified Matuta with Leucothea, the
daughter of Cadmus. 664. dispersos eto: edd. refer to Diod.
Siculus, 17, 36, where this phenomenon is described at length3 cf.
. also Id. 3, 47. It was doubtless due to refraction. In some regions

the sun olten appears of irregular shape. 669. certo ctc.: the poet
here, as often, appeals to the observcd fact of the unifonnity of na·
ture and the regularity ol natural processes. cf. 1, 174 et seq. and n.
to 1, 586. 671. arbusta: see n. to 1, 187. 677. luerunt: sce
nto 1‚406. ⁶79· conseque: see nn. to 1, 215-211d 560. Cerere·
qr'ie quoque iam redeunt is Lachmann’s emend. ior consequioe quoque
iam rerum. 681. luces: for dier, as often. 682. autr the
correlatives are below, 696 and 701.-idem: ‘the same' sun as
opposed to the notion in 701-3of afresh sun every morning.
684 orbem: ‘orbib’ 685 etseq. In running courses of un·
equal length above and below the earth, the sun adds just as much to

ι the one part as is taken from the other; the longer that part oi his
course above the earth is, just so much the shorter that part below the
earth will be, and vice versa. The inequality will continue till the sun
reaches the equinoxes (anni nodus), at which the day and the night are
equal in length. 689. cursu: ior cursu solta-flatus: gen. after s
meaio ‘midway between.' 690. metas: usually explained as the sl fl* · ’
two tropics. M unro, with good reason, makes it refer to the points
where the sun rises and sets; “the heaven keeps his two goals at an
equal distance from north and south, i.e., speaking roughly the sun ··
rises and sets due east and vvest ; '' and this is so ‘on account oi the
positioil oi the whole starry circle! ⁶95· notarunt: ‘mapped out!
701. sie: i.e., aare crassiore. 703. certa parte: “aparticular ·
quarter, which varies every day throughout the year,’' Munro ex·
plains. After 704 a verse has fallen out, Munro thinks, something ·
like qui ficiunt solis nova semper lumina gagrri ,· otherwise 704 is well· .
nigh meaningless where it stands3 Lachmann attaches it to 703, and ,
makes no change, but with extreme violence to the sense.

(6) me moon may borrow its light from the sun, or alaine with its own
light, or be made aneto every day. 705-7 50.

707. speciem: ‘sight'; so 7243 4, 236 and 242· 7⁰⁸· donique:
old form oi donec, found also 723, 997; 2, 1116; donicum also is some-
times met with in thenolder writers. See Neue,‘ Formenlehre,' ii. 8053
