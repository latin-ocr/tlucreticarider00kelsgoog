LUCRETIUS As A PHILOSOPHER xxvii

shape as the bodies from which they come, of movement incon·
ceivably switt.1 From the contact ot these with the eyes vision
results. A square tower in the distance appears round, because
the idols in passing through the air are blunted, and have the
sharp corners worn down. From polished suriaces the idols
rebound; hence the reflection oi mirrors, But they pass
through certain substances‚ as glass‚ so that the sight is not
hindered. To men with the jaundice things look greenish be-
cause of the greenish particles thrown off from the eyes, which
meet the coming idols and tinge them with that hue. The eyes
cannot bear to look at the sun because ot the impinging force oi
its idols and the seeds of fire in them.² The sense of hearing
distinguishes different sounds accordingto the different kinds oi
atoms in them3 for that sound is of material nature is made
clear by the hoarseness following much use ot the voice, which
results from the iriction of sound-atoms as they pass out oi
the throat The penetrating power of sounds shows how
minute the sound-atoms must be.8 The senses of smcll and
taste experience pleasure from the contact ot smooth atoms, dis-
comlort from the presence of those rough or jagged.⁴

The finest idols even penetrate directly to the mind, which
is fitted thus to receive impressions from its physical nature.
Sometimes there is a mingling and confusion of idols in the air,
and mongrel forms seem to be perceived to which there is no
bodily reality corresponding3 from such originated the concep-
tions of Centaurs‚ Scyllas, and the like.⁵ As idols innumerable,
oi things past as well as present, are ever thronging before the
mind, it admits in waking hours only those that it wishes to
receive3 hence the power ot menrory.⁶ In slumher too the
idols come, and then men have dreanrs, sometimes even horrid
visions oi monsters and human figures larger than life, and the
forms os the dead.⁷ In the relation of the senses to the things
perceived and the phenomena ot sensation no evidence of design
