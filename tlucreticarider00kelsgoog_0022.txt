LUCRETIUS As A MAN xv

Yet the poet had little saith that his efforts to free men from
their bondage would ever reach or aid thern. Gloomily he came
to think that they do not wish to know the true reason, They
will ever wander in error. An undertone of sadness runs like a
minor chord through the entirepoem. Lucretius has been
called, with a certain fitnesS, the poet of death.1 But he is not
