LUCRETIUS As A ΡΟΕΤ xlix

clearly out oi place, probably inserted hythe poet as a make·
shift till some better setting could be found for them. The
allusion to Cicero's editorship in the passage from Jerome
quoted above has given rise to much discussion ; some, as Lach-
mann, think that Quintus Cicero is referred to, while Munro
and others suppose that the orator is meant Of course Jerome
had the orator in mind, for in his day as now, when Cicero
was spoken of, men thought of the great Cicero. Although
there is some reason sor supposing that Quintus acted as editor

of the poem, it is far more likely that the task fell upon Marcus,
who “may have spent onlya few hours in looking over it or
hearing it read to him; his name rather than his time was proh
ably wanted by the friends of Lucretius.'' At any rate the
poem seems to have been “given to the world exactly as it was

left by the author, with nothing added or taken from it to all
appearance.” Thus says the highest critical authority upon the
text, and his statement may be sustained by many evidences
which it is not necessary to present. Suffice it to say that not-
withstanding the uncompleted state of the poem, and the hope·
less corruptions and lacunae, there is manifest a literary ability
unexcelled by that of any Latin writer. ln the uniolding and
treatment of the organic idea, as well as in the manner of ex-
pression and the music ol the verse, poetic genius oi a high
order is revealed.

The De Rerum Natura is a didactic poem with an ethical
purpose. The organic idea is‚-without the activity or inter·
vention of any divine power the processes oi nature and oi life
ever go on. The purpose is,-to free men from the ilis of
superstition. Herein is sounded the hey-note of the whole.
The aimand the organic idea are never lost sight of. Hence -
the poem possesses unity3 the parts all tit into a general plan.
There is something like an epic movement, which does not
come from the verse alone, but from the onward sweep ol
thought. Especially in certain passages about lile and death
and the actions of men, and in some descriptions of changes,
the true epic spirit is felt.
