LUCRETIUS As A PHILOSOPHER xxi

01 atoms 01 medium weight. The heaviest 01 themselves drew
together, giving rise to the earth ; as this became compact‚ light,
round particles were squeezed out into the hollow places, making
the sea. The earth, formerly moving about, is now stationary,
at the centre 01 the world; it has the shape oi a 1131 cylinder.
From it, when fresh and moist, plants and animals arose.

For the gods the system 01 Democritus 111110 10011. But in
the course 01 nature he recognized something that 111 called
divine, and he seems to have been inclined to an allegorical iuter-
pretation 01 the popular beliefs. Man he revered as nature’s
highest worhdwelling at length upon the symmetry 01 the human
form, the adaptation 01 part to 1111111101, the unity and perfectiori
oi the whole. The soul‚ he taught, is composed 01 the finest
and roundest atoms‚ and it is distributed through the body as

thing outside the body. Stili, the senses do not reveal trnly the
external world. By some process, which the philosopher as-
sumes but does not explain, the thought is able in the midst

The soul‚ said Democritus, is the noblest part 01 man. The
body is merely its 011111,2 and should be made subject to it.
