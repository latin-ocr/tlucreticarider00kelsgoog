stlte'runt and the like could not stand in hexameter verset but as is
shown by Munro, and by Wagner, n. on Ter. Eun. 20, the shortening
of the vowel did not always arise from the necessity ot the metre;
cf. 5,474fulrunt; {runt was probably not an uncommon pronunciation.

411. de plano: a phrase irom the lawcourts, referring to decisione
rendered informally anywhere, as distinguished from those ex loco
superiore, ie„ from the elevated seat oi the judge in formal trial. Out
oi the technical meaning ‘off the bench,’ ‘intormally,' came the use
here‚=‘readily,’ ‘easily' 412-417. ln antiquity the display of
firm seliconfidence was reckoned almost avirtue. Livy says oi Rom·
ulus (1, 10) cum fnctisvir magnificustnm factorum ostentator haut minor,
a characterization that well exemplifies the Roman spirit. In philos·
ophy the earlier Stoics and Epicureans showed an uncompromising
dogmatism, which, professing to know the whole truth, treated with
contempt all theories but their own. Among the poets the same spirit
was manifested ior the most part in bold prophecies oi immortality
ior their productions; Ennius, Vergil, Horace, Ovid, Propertius, and
Martial ioretold the honors that posterity would pay to them. So, too,
Shakespere has said,-

“ Not marble nor the gilded monuments
Os princes shall outlast this powerlul thyme.

In Lucr. there was no touch oi vanity or overweeuing seli-assertion.
Fired by his great design oi trecing men from the ills oi superstition,
