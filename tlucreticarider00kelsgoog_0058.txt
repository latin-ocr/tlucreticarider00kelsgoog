LUCRETIUS As A POET li

recognition of the same principle that leads the epic poets' to
rush in medeas res, leaving the less important or preceding
matters to be presented later by narration. The details, like
the general plan, are frequently arranged by the poet with the
same sense of poetic fitness. The points that go to establish
an argument are artistically put in array. While the form ot
statement is so varied as not to give the impression of a logi·
cal series, they ascend with cumulative force, often coming to
an end with a sharp appeal tov common sense or an ironical
illustration to silence the unconvinced. At times however,
cold logie dominates, and the poet sinks almost to the level of

prose.
Lucretius’ manner of expression is plain, direct, and lorcible.

The poets in whom he seems most to have delighted were
Homer, Euripides, Empedocles (styled Homeric by Aristotle)
and Ennius. He had also read much Cicero’s ‘Aratea‚’—a
work in places exceedingly spirited and apt in expression. But
while Lucretius occasionally shows the influence of other

writers, his style has a marked individuality. There is little of
the ‘highest art that conceals art;' there is rather the vigor of
native genius that cared nothing for beauty of expression for its
own sake, but merely sought for a form of language that could
in some degree convey the vividness of conception. Hence he
did not hesitate to coin new words; and some of the com·

pounds he formed areos rare expressiveness. Poetic pleon-
asms, by which he gave prominence to a conception in holding
it before the thought, are common enough 3 but while his range
of epithets is large, he never lavishes them needlessly. Tech-
nical terms, considering the character of his subject, are few3
and owing to the almost epic simplicity and directness ot state-
ment, the most subtle arguments are set forth with clearness
anll accuraey oi expression. Yet little obscurities‚ which some·
times arise from the use of the same word in different senses
and from the form of the construction, he passes over without
heed. The epic tone of the poem is heightened by the not
infrequent use ot archaisms.
