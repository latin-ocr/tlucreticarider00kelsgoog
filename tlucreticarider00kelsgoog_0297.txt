Iph. Aul. 1222 πρώτη a‘ ἐκάλεσα narba real ab παῖδ’ ἐμὲ See also
Munro's note. 95-98. In these lines edd. notice the subtle con·
trast between the joyiul wedding-scene for which the girl supposed she
had come to Aulis and the terrible reality ot her d00m‚-a contrast
heightened by the studied use oi terms common to both marriage and
sacrifice. 95. sublata etc: there isan implied reference to the
symbolic seizure oi the bride from her mother in the wedding cere·
rnony, and perhaps to the carrying oi the bride over the threshold of
her husband. For this and the other marriage ceremonies alluded to,
see Becker, ‘Gallus’ erc. 1, sc. 1; also Ramsay, ‘ Man. of Rom. Antiq.'
96. deducta: this word was also used of the ceremonious conduct-
ing ot the bride to her new home-sacrorum: one form of the
Roman marriage was celebrated by the sacrifice ol sheep (Becker,
utmp. p. 158), and could not be properly concluded without the talr·
ing oi auspices. 97. claro: refers to sound; ‘clear-ringing.’-
comitari: passive-Hymenaeo: ‘nuptial song.’ As the bride the
evening of the wedding day together with her husband left her iather’s
house, a throng with torches chanting the marriage-song escorted them
to their new home, and sang as they entered it. Catullus (Carm. 62)
has leit us a splendid specimen ot the carmen terminale, in the iorm
oi a ehoral chant, with youths and maidens responding alternately.
98. casta inceste: ‘sinless sinfully.' For the paronomasia cf. 3, 1015
insignibus insignit ,· 2, 1054 innumera reremero ,⁴ 2, 1086. 99. mac·
tatu: found only here. roo. exitus: ie. from Aulis-felix
faustusque: these words were often coupled together in old formu·
las oi prayer, to which the early Romans attached great significance,
and with which they began all transactione or worlr ot importance. Cf.
Cic. Div. Ι, 4 5, 102 nominum, qnae vocant anit'na; qttere mar'ares nostri
qnia valere censebant, ideirco amitibus rebnsagendn ‘quod bortum, saus·
