the nss. 315. strata viarum: see n. to 86. The phrase in·
eludes not merely the streets of citieS, but also the paved highways,
as the Via Appia. -propter: see n. to 90. 317. signa: statues
ol the go'ds were often placed near the city gates to receive the wor-
ship of those who entered. See Pausanias 4, 33, ᾖ 4. This custom is
thought to explain the reference in Acts 14, 13 ὅ τε ἱερεὺς τοῦ Διὸς τοῦ
ὄντος πρὸ τῆς πόλεως, ταύρους καὶ στέμματα ἐπὶ τοὺς πυλῶνας ἐνέγκας,
σὺν τοῖς ὄχλοις ἤθελεν θύειν. The Greeks appear to have touched or
kissed the chin of statues, the Romans the right hand. A parallel to
the fact noticed by Lucr. maybe seen in many European churches aud
cathedrals The right foot of the bronze statue of St. Peter in
St. Peter’s at Rome is almost entirely worn away by the kisses of
devotees. 318. salutantum . . . meantum: hysteron proteron.
For the spelling see n. to 1, 4 animantum ; praeterque meantum, perhaps
a tmesis; but see n. to 66 contra. 321. speciem r == virium ‘the
nature of vision has jealously shut out our seeing! 322. dies: as
in ²33· 325. vesco: ‘corroding.’ Vescus, connected in derivation
with vescor (verder, veeseo, vesco, Vanicek,‘Etym. Whrtb! p. 28),
has lost the active sense except here and in a very few other pas·
sages. See Munro's note. 327. quoque: quaque, as above 320.
328. natura gerit: see n. to 56. 'l'he rnetaphor here, as Munro
remarks, is taken from the government of astate.

2. There is void, in which Atoms move and
are acted on. 329-417.

Tlrere is void (329-334). If there were not, motion would nothe
possible (335-345l. Besides, all things are penetruble, admittier other
bodies alato tlrem ον through them (346-357). The'ttys estlee sante site
dtffiv in wer'grlrt (358-369).

329. stipata: ‘packed together'; acommon word in Lucr. 33ο.
inane: a substantive,=rl κενόν, which was defined by Arist. (Phys.
4, 1, 6) as τόπος ἐστερημένος σώματος, ‘place devoid ol body.' For
‘void’ Lucr. also has vacuum, once vacans in 444 inane vacansque.
He uses also spatium, locus,‚and the like, but less definitely, to desig·
nate the room or space in which things exist. 331. in mul. rebus: .
‘in many respects) 333. summa rerum: here=the universe. .
334. This line is doubtless spurious. It was first rejected by Bent-
ley. 335, quod esset : i. e. inane existeret. 336. officium ς ‘property'
