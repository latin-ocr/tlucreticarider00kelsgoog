LUCRETIUS As A PHILOSOPHER xliii

Even Boyle thought that the atoms cohere by reason oi their
jagged shapes. The three agreed, however, in looking to the
power oi God as final cause in the building up of things out of
atoms. With the discovery ol the law of gravitation the course
of physical speculation was changed. Gradually the doctrine
of attraction and repulsion‚ the conception of forces acting im·
mediately in the relations of atoms one with another, was intro·
duced. The new principle seemed so potent and wide-reaching
in its application‚ that an all-moving spirit hardly seemed neces·
sary in accounting for the on-going of the universe. A tendency
to the mechanica} explanation ot nature became manifest. In
accordance with the spiritui this, Locke formulated his doctrine
os sensationalism‚ which so harmonized with the trend os the
times that it was most widely adopted as embodying the true
theory oi knowledge. The unfolding and application of its doc·
trines revolutionized European speculation, leading directly to
the French “ illumination,'' with the rise oi a materialistic theory
of the universe and a utilitarian theory ot morals. At present,
. the mechanica] explanation oi nature under the form of the
evolution hypothesis is again struggling for the mastery.

The atom ot modern science is the atom of Lucretius without
the power oi swerving. But Lucretius had no proper concep-
tion οἱ sorce. Here at once his physical theory breaks down.
For the doctrine of attraction he had'only the poor substitute of
varied shapes oi atoms to keep them in combination. Repulsion‚
indeed, he loreshadowed in the importance he attached to the
rebounding of atoms and masses alter impact: but without the
assumption oi force this rebounding is inconceivable, because
the atoms are considered absolutely hard, and hence must be
inelastic. For the inherent downward tendency ol atoms, mod·
ern science substitutes vibratory motion ; it agrees with Lucre-
tius in supposing the movements oi atoms to be inconceivably
swiit. It agrees with him also iu believing that all the processes
oi nature take place in accordance with certain laws of universal
sway and invariable action. For afinal cause the theistic physi-
cist looks to au all-intelligent, all-potent God, who gave to atoms
