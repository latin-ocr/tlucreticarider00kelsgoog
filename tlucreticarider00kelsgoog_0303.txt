a means of securing peace oi mind. Upon this ethical purpose oi
all science the Epicureans laid great stress. See Zeller‚ ‘Stoics, Epi·
cureans, and Sceptics,’ ch. 17. 146. animi: thegen. would natu·
rally come either before terrorem or after tenebras. G. 682; H. 564,
I. 11. A word standing in the same relation to two others, however, is
oft'en placed between them, — a usage by the old grammarians called
coniunctio. See Cornificius ad Herennium 4, 38 coniunctio est mm
interpositione verbi et superiores orationis partes comprehenduntur et
inferiores, hoc modo .· Formae dignitas aut morbo deflorescit out vetitstate.
This arrangement of words is especially common in Cicero. Cf. Cic.
De Am. 2, 8 cum summi viri tum amz'cissipni and Reid’s note.
148. species ratioque: ‘aspect and law,’ well distinguished by Munro
as “ the outward form and aspect '⁹ and “the inner law and principle
after which nature develops herself.’' See n. to 586. 149. ‘The
warp of whose design we shall begin with this first principle ’ς cf. 4183

150. So Democritus taught3 see Diog. Laert. 9, 44 Δοκεῖ δὲ . . . μη·
δέν τε ἐκ τοῦ μὴ ὄντος nitendum and Epicurus in his letter to Herodo-
tus says (id. 10, 24, 38) πρῶτον μὲν ὅτι οὐδὲν ’γίνεται ἐκ τοῦ μὴ ὄντος.
That nothing can be produced from nothing was a doctrine common to
all thc ancient physicists as well asto modern materialists. Who first
definitely formulated it is not known; before the time of Aristotle it
seems to have become current as a physical axiom. This line of Lucr.
has bcen interpreted to mean that nothing can happen without ade·
quate cause (sce Tait and Stewart, ‘The Unseen Universe,’ p. 132),-
a tcaching that helda prominent place in the Stoic philosophy; but
a comparison with the statement of Epicurus, whom Lucr. so closely
followed, shows clearly that the reference is to the coming of the
existent out of the non-existent. Cf. Haeckel‚ ⁴ Nat. Histoi Crea-
ti0n,'ch.1: ‘⁴ Never yet has an instance been observed of even the
smallcst particle of matter having vanished, or even of an atom being
added to the already existing mass.” Praetically‚indced, in the hands
of the experimenter matter is indestructible, andis hence inferred fo
be without beginning; but the modern materialists are as a rule less
dogmatic rcgarding its eternal existence than the ancient. See
Haeclrel, nt snp.; llerbert Spencer, ‘First Principles,' Part 2, ch. 4.
The denial that by any agency matter can come into existence from
nothing involves necessarily its eternal pre-existence3 and this vio
’ates the law of causality. For matter, in the ordinary acceptation of
