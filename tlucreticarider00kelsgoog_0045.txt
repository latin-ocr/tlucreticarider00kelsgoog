xxxviii INTRODUCTION

acquiesce in the absolute authority oi the Greek philosophy,
though their minds were not inventive enough to establish a
rival by its side.’'¹ Lucretius ought not to be considered a ser-
vile imitator ol Epicurus. The doctrines which he accepted he

ardently believed in; and he fully assimilated them in both
their general range and minor details When, therefore, for the
sake ol his countrymen he began to expouod them, they carne
forth glowing from the depths of his heart and soul, and bore
not simply an individual but a distinctively Roman stamp. No
work oi the entire literature shows more clearly the bent oi the
national character. The earnestness of purpose, the freedom ·
lrorn quibbling or sophistry and the straightiorward grappliug
with leading questions, the emphasizing ol the simpler modes
ol lile and the homelier virtues, the stern and solemn, even
gloomy view ol existence, —all point to traits not merely of the
man but also os the nation.

The poem also indicates clearly the tendencies of the age.
It is a protest against the degrading influences of impure super·
stitions3 against the sham and increasing degeneracy of society3
against the reckless, mad ambitions and ceaseless ferment oi
political life. In a period grossly material in tastes and enjoy-
ments, when great fortunes were being rapidly made and were
ever bringing new luxuries iu their traiu, it bids men take refuge
and find true happiness in higher thingS, in pleasures of the
soul rather than the body. The mission ol Lucretius was to set
forth the atomic Materialism as it appeared acceptable rothe
Roman mind and adapted to meet the needs of the Roman
character fora philosophy of life and rule of duty. Just so it
was the mis‘sion oi Seneca to expouod Pantheism to his country-
men; and in the almost religious fervor of his utterances about
virtue and right living there is manifested the same spirit that
stirred our poet.

The influence of Lucretius' poem as a philosophie work can·
not be easily traced or readily estimated. The Latin writers ol
