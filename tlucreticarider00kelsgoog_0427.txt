shines with its own light, the complete or partial withdrawal of its
brightness at times may be accounted ior in two ways: either a dark
body 111 1 regular course through the heavens partly or entirely hides
it from us (717-9); or it may be bright only on one side, and, being
spherical, in the course of its revolutions may present to us first the
light and then the dark side, with varying phases (720—730). 720.
potest: i.e., lana-globus pilait ‘spherical ball.’-si forte: =
sortasse, εἰ τύχοι, Munro remarks, and serves as a connecting particle
in passing to a new hypothesis, being about the same as est ettam at
versari possit, ut globus etc. 723. quaecumque: see n. to 1, 1043;
campartem, of course, refers to the bright side 01 the moon. 726.

see n. to 1‚1 divam ‚· it depends, 01 course, on doctrina. Berosus ο1
Babylon (lived in the first 11111 01 the third century uc.) and his 101-

those who held that the moon's light is derived from the sun, as most
01 the Greeks who did not personify the sun and moon taught.
This view is said to have been first set forth by Anaximenes (see Zel-
ler, ‘Prae-Soc. Phil' i. 275 for 111. to original authorities); the
Pythagoreans, however, believed that the moon, like the sun, isa
glassy sphere‚ which reflects light and heat back to the earth from the
central fire3 Anaxagoras arrd Democritus agreed that both sun and
moon are bodies ο1 earthy nature, heated by the motion 01 the sky;
and Xenophanes said that the moon burns out and is kindled afresh.
This last view has been attributed to Heraclitus also, but on insuffi-

this last view the poet himself most inclines; it is, in fact, the most
consistent with his system. With the alternatives proposed here by
Lucr. 11. Epicurus, Diog. Laert. 10, 94-5: ‘The waxings and waning
