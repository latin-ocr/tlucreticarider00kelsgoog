But while Lucretius had no biographer and did not, like
Horace and Ovid, tell his life out in his verse, his personality is
by no means obscure. No poem, ancient or modern, shows
more clearly than the De Rerum Natura the impress of a marked
individuality. Some poets voice a general feeling, or paint a
pleasing lancy, or describe an experience, in such a way one
cannot tell whether they are giving an insight into their own
hearts and lives or not. But not so Lucretius. In the eourse
ot his reasoning he speaks in the first person, often with direct
address bids Memmius heed what he is saying.l His diction is
characterized by a vehemence and straightforwardness of state-
ment that ean have their source only in sincerity and firm con-

viction. He never trifles. Whether he is reasoning about the
atom, or explaining natural phenomeua‚ or hurling fierce invec-

tives against the blind thraldom of men under superstition, he is
always terribly in earnest. Between the lines of the poem we
read the man.

ln Lucretius the fire and graphic power ot the poet were
aptly blended with the calm logie and constructive ability ol the
philosopher. With the poet’s eye he looked out upon the world,
and scanned the lise of men3 with philosophie sweep of thought
he marshalled in array all the facts that he had gained, ancl tried
to track out causes, to know the origin and modes ol being, to
fathom the mystery of the universe.² Few of the ancients lived
in so close sympathy with nature as he;⁸ yet he loved not
nature for her own sake. He had what Tyndall· calls the

seape or of the sea and the discovery of natural proeesses unno-
ticed by the common throng awoke indeed a responsive chord;
but all these lorthwith were made to serve in the illustrating or
enioreing os some truth, took their place iu his philosophie sys-
tem. ln the presence oi the problem of the universe he had
