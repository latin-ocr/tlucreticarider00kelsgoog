378—80. The atoms of soul must have between them spaces at
least as great as the size of the snrallest bodies (corpora), which
can first (prima) excite sensation by coming in contact with the body
(in corpore). “But does not the body feel '’ (Munro well explains)
“as well as the soul? Yes ; he has elaborately proved already that
the one feels as well as the other, and that neither of the two can
possibly feel without the other; but he has also shown that the irzr'trcs
motus must proceed from the animo, and not merely from the anima
but that part of it which is the artimus, and not merely from the arti·
mus, but from that fourth nameless substance in it; the arilina and
animus then form one connected whole in the body; if, therefore, any
atoms of the anima are moved they will at once communicate with
the animus, and sense will commence and be imparted to the whole
anima, and from the anim to the body which will then feel. But
many atoms of the body, lre argues, may be touched without any part
of the soul being moved, and, therefore, without there being any com-
mencement of sensation.” Cf. 391-5 below. 381. adhaesum
