ety to the ignorant and credulous, the forms of worship were still
kept up. Many, indeed, particularly the Stolos, tried by rationalistic
explanations to adapt the old myths about gods and heroes to their
philosophie views. Cf. eg. 2, 652-660. But they were inwrought into
the folk-lite oi both Greece and Rome. Attempts to explain them to
accord with natural law were never popular. Finally, discarded as
belieis they remained as poetry. To Ennius, Lucretius, to Catullus,
Vergil and Horace, gods and goddesses were but stuff for poetry,-
conceptions about which were gathered associations bright and beauti-
ful, or sad and stem,¹ traditions oi power and passion that gave scope ’
ior all sorts oi poetic license. Bnt in this and like passages· the per·
sonification oi sky and earth doubtless meant iar more to Lucr. than

Munrn quotes one form oi it in Greek from Arist. Met, 2, 2, p. 994,
b, 57¹1 θατέρου φθορὰ θατέρου ἐστὶ γένεσις. Of the doctrine itself he
well remarks that “as here applied to this world of oure, it is perhaps
hardly consistent with what is said below 556, that the process oi

Lucr. argues at great length and with much earnestness that this
