282 LUCRETIUS [l. 923-

see n. to 136. 9²³· thyrso: the poet speaks of himself under the
imagery ol one at the Bacchic festival roused to inspired frenzy by
the touch oi the wreath-girt spear or pole the devotees oi the wine·
god carried. — laudis spes: in antiquity, desire of praise was reck·
oned a chief and proper motive of conduct. Several ancient writers
speak of it as a ruling power in directing the lives oi the greatest
men; Cicero, in particular, contesses his own love ol glory; and in
several places emphasizes the common argument for the immor-
tality oi the soul, that the dead continue to exert an active influente
on the living in order to keep alive their fame. cf. n. to 41²·7·
924. mi: tor mihi. 925. instinctus: finspired’] olten used with
reference to a divine influence. Cf. Quin. 12, ro, 24 instinctis divino

928-930. In like manner Horace tells of how he brought new honors
to the Latin tongue‚ and glory to himself, by introducing the Greek
measures; and Cicero, more than once, speaks of his mission as the
first expounder of the Greek philosophy to his fellowcountrynren.
Perhaps these lines suggested Hor. Od. 1, 7, 5-7 :—

sunt, quibus unum opus est intactae Palladis urbem
carmine perpetuo celebrare et
undique decerptam srouti praeponere olivam.

932· Part oi this line is quoted by Lactantius (De Ver. Sap. 4, 28)
to sustain his derivation of religio lrom religare, in opposition to the
