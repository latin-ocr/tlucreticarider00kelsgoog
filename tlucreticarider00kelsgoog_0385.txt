The two following arguments are closely related,
and also assume the doctrine of pre-existence:-

(18) If the sonl were introduced into man at birth, it would not per·
vade the entire body, but be gothered together in one particular spot, as iu o
hele by e'tsels,· whereas on the contrary the whole body, even to the teeth
ared bones, is sensium. 679»697.
