‘thou’ iails to bring out the relation with the preceding thought
which the relative in the more accurate and subtle Latin idiom
expresses.

rerum naturam: Lucretius uses natura in many different senses·
Here and in 25 by natura rerum is meant what we often understand
by ‘ nature‚’- the sum and system of things existent; as Humboldt
defines it (‘Cosmos,' tr. by otte', Introd.): “Nature considered ra,-
tionally, that is to say, submitted to the process oi thought, is a
unity in diversity of phenomena; a harmony, blending together oi
all created things, however dissimilar in form and attributes; one
great whole (τὸ πᾶν) animated with the breath of life.’' Oiten oui·
poet personifies nature, regards her as a mysterious living presence,
that “makes herself felt as a peculiar and independent power.'' Cf.
especially 2, 1090—92: ‘If you keep in mind these things well
thought out, nature untrammelled at once and free from haughty
masters is seen oi her own accord by herself without the power of
the gods to do all things.' The idea of a will behind all movement
is so firmly impressed upon the minds of men that, strive as they may
to believe inpure chance or necessity, they generally end by personi-
fying something. Fate in antiquity was only a personification of
natural law. It is a significant fact that materialists oi our own time
often spell matter and evolution with capital letters. Evolution, a
process, takes the place of a deity, and matter is thought to contain
the “promise and potency oi all terrestrial life” (Tyndall). “It
seems almost a matter oi taste whether we worship the masculine God,
the feminine Nature, or the neuter All.'' Lange, ‘Hist oi Material-
ism‚’ tr. iii. 340. On Lucretius’ conception of Nature as a person-
ality, see Ritter, ι11151. of Ancient Philosophy,' Bohn’s ed. iv. 87-88.
Lucr. also uses the word natura to express ‘natural constitution' of
a thing, ‘substance,’ and the like.

serve the chiasmus. Α. 344,],’ G. 684; H. 562. A like arrange·
ment oi words often adds a charm to English style, as in Milton’s
“dulcet symphonies and voices sweet.'' 22. luminis oras: a
favorite expression of Lucr, by which he suggests the dim bordet-
land between that which is and that which is not, the existent aud the
non-existent. See Munro's note. 25. de rerum natura: whence
Lucr. drew the title of his work can only be conjectured ssepi pb
