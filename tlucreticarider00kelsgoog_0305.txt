240 LUCRETIUS [1. 159-

It was oiten omitted also in the older inscriptions, as those of the
Scipios. At that time to glide over the final s in speaking was re·
garded as a mark oi refinement, - as, indeed, it seems to be considered
by some t0·day; but when Cicero wrote it was already in bad taste.
Cf. Cic. Orator 161 quinetiam, quod iam subrusticum ut'detur, olim autem
politius, eoreem uerborum, quorum eaedem erant postremae duae litterae,
quae suut iu ‘opta'mus', postremam litteram detrahebant, nisi vocalis
insequebatur. The tendency of the language, however, was fixed, and
sfinal with other final consonants has entirely disappeared in Italian.
A. 375,a; G. 7223 H. 608, Ι. 11. 3. 160. genus: supply rerum.

. The limiting genitive with genus is often omitted; cf. 2, 4473 3, 483.

The argument here is precisely that of Epicurus: ‘First, indeed,
(we are to admit) that nothing is produced from the non-existent3
for (if it could be) everything would be produced irum everything;
of seeds, at least, nothing would have need’ See Diog. Laert. 10,
, 24, 38. 161. mare 1 the abl. ends regularly in i, as 6, 8903 mareis
occasionally found in other writers. See Roby‚ ‘ Gr! 429. Neue gives
full list' oi examples, ‘Formenlehre’ 1. 229-230. 16031111εωὶ-
gerum: gen. pl.; ci.2‚1083 and n. on 1 drasam. This word is first
met with in Cicero’s translation of the ⁴ Phaenomena' oi AratuS, 328
(574) exin squanngeri serpentes ludere pisces, whence the poet likely
drew it; for he seems to have studicd with admiration this youthful
work oi Cicero's, and in many instances to have been indebted to it.
163. armenta: armenta and pectides are both tame animals as opposed
to genusserarum ; the tormer word refers to the larger sort, especially
plough-oren aud horses; the latter to the smaller, as the lesser cattle,
sheep, goats etc. See Dtiderleim ‘Lat Synonyms.' 164. tene·
rent: like posset above and the following subjunctives, a verb of an
apodosis whose protasis is to be supplied irom 159. 166. icrre ete:
oraues arbores omnis fruetus (ie. omnia fruetuum xmarera) ferre possent.
167. ubi: almost = st ; so also cum is ,sometimes used to introduce
a conditional clause-genitalia corpora: see n. to 55 primordio.
158. qui: old abl. with the force of an adv.: ‘how could things have
afixed,unvaryingm0ther?’ 169. at nunc: ‘but as it is.’ At is
often used to introduce an objection to a preceding statement, some·
times correcting the false with the true as here, sometimes bringing
iorward a conflicting statement that is to be met, as 803. where see n.
