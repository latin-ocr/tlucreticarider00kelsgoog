agnis potesse etc Like the English do th is id facere often takes the .
place oi a clause. The reasoning in 665«) seems to be: In no other ·'
way than through void can rarefaction and condensation of stre take
plaee; but void these philosophers utterly reject; so then their notion

oi a primitive fireessence is exploded, and they must tall back to the
position that all things existent are produced from nothing.

670-1. These lines are repeated r, 792-3; 2, 753—4; 3, 519-520, to
emphasize the doctrine that each thing has a limited power, a circum·
seribed sphere ot existence, outside ol which change of form and
destruction will meet it. See n. to 76. 672. proindet in Lucr. ,
usually scanned as a dissyllable; ‘hence' ‘therefore.’-aliquit : see
n. to 469 aliut. - ollis: archaic ior illis,· common in Lucr. The root M,-
is ol· as in olim. ⁶73· tibi: ethical dat.,irequent in Lucr. In Eng-
lish the pronouns oi the first and second persons are thus used often
by the earlier, sometimes even by the later writers. ct. Shakspere, ¹ ,

676-7. Cf. the words ot Epicurus in Diog. Laert. 10, 24, 54: ‘In
the dissolution ot combined bodies of necessity there remains some·
thing solid and indestructible, which will not undergo change into the
non-existent nor from it. Changes, however, it will undergo, in most
cases by mutation ot parts, but in some by the coming and going oi
atoms [. . . ἀλλὰ κατὰ μεταθέσεις ἐν πολλοῖς· ἐπὶ τινῶν δέ, κατὰ

idiom is very frequent in the French and German reflexive verbs.

683. crearent: for subject refer back to 679 haec ignea corporo.
684 ita. ι here as often looks lorward to that which follows. 685.
concursus: see n. to 633-4: ordo, arrangement ot atoms in the mass;
posituro, position, relative to other atoms; figurae, ‘shapes,’ fully
discussed 2, 333-580. 687. naturam: ie. ol things, not ot atoms,
because these are incapable ot change. 688-9. These lines refer
to the Epicurean theory of sense-perception, that from the suriaces of
things there are continually thrown off thin films oi matter that strike
upon our senses, and thus by impact excite sensation. For fuller dis·
