534. med. mundi reg: cf. 1, rosz'ct seq. and rm. The universe
has no centre, but the world has. Lucr. nowhere gives a hint as to his
idea of the earth’s shape. From his rejection of the belief in the
antipodes, however, and from what is said here ot a nature beneath
supporting it, we may suppose that he conceived of it as flat. Epicurus
(Diog. Laert. 10, 74) says that ‘we are not to suppose that the worlds
oi necessity have one and the same shape.’ According to Diog.
Laert. he taught that some are sphericai, some elliptical, and others
of other shapes. Regarding the shape ot the earth, however, no defi·
nite statement oi his has come down to us; he merely says that it
rests suspended on the air (τὴν γῆν τῷ ἀέρι ἐπιχεῖσθαι). This is sug·
gestive of the view ot Anaximenes, that the earth is broad and fiat,
and is supported by the air. Leucippus and Democritus supposed it
to be “an exceedineg flat cylinder, which supports itseit on the air
by means of its breadth.” 537. uniter: seen. to 3, 839. 538. vi-
vit: truly a strange word for a thorough-going materialist to apply to
the earth Ancient thought was permeated with hylozoistic and pan·
theistic ideas, cf. n. to 514 aeterni. 544. per multo: should be
permulto. 545. quid etc: ‘what iunction each thing has to per-
form? 560. potis: see n. to 1, 452. F or the thought cf.3, 161
etseq.

(3) Tlrc sun, the moon, and the stars areos about the same sr'ze that they
seem lo us to be. 564-591.

564-5. Cf. the statement of Epicurus, Diog. Laert. 16, 91 ‘In re-
gard to the size of both the sun and the other heavenly bodies, it is
indeed, as far as pertains to us, such as it appears to be.' This doc-
trine seems to have been peculiar to Epicurus and his followers.
Leucippus and Democritus held that the sun is much larger than the
earth, and that the shadows oi mountains can be traced on the
moon’s surface. Cf. Cic. De Fin. 1, 6, ²03 Acad. 2, 26, 823 Plut.
Plac. 2, 21, 43 Sen. N. Q. 1, 3, 10. 564 solis rota: cf. 432.
566. quibus...cumque: tmesis. 568.i11a:spotia. 571. loca:
i.e., corporum nostrorum. 572. iilum: ‘sire’ 575. notho: ‘not
genuine,’ i.e., ‘not her own,' ‘borrowed' Whether the moon shines
with her own or with borrowed light cannot be known, and makes no
difference3 the size is not greater than it appears to be. Cf. 705 etseq.
and nn. 578. quam: supply figura. 579. prius: with 581quam.
