accomplished, which, through a process of development, resulted in
the present universe. Opinions as to the value of Empedocles' sys-
tem were in antiquity very diverse; and so they remain today. From
him Lucr. received many suggestions even taking his poem ssepi
Φύσεως as a model (see n. to 25). To the likeness oi his views to
those of the Atomists and Epicuream the iulsome praise here is due.
But Plato, Aristotle, and especially the NeoPlatonists, held Emp. in
much less esteem. From the evidence collected by Zeller (‘ Prae-Soc.
Phil’ vol. ii.) the significance oi his speculations seems to lie in three
things: (r) He was the first to introduce into philosophy the concep
tion oi a movingcause independenter matter,-in this foreshadowing
Anaxagoras, who assumed an intelligent cause, Νοῦς, Mind. (al He
brought into natural science the conception oi primitive elements l as
opposed to a single form of matter). He fixed the number at four, a
number which, aiter his time, was generally accepted in antiquity, and
lingered till modern chemistry by experimeut laid the foundation ior
a correct theory. Thus he became, along with Leucippus, “the founder
oi the mechanical explanation oi the universe.” (3) In explaining
the development of animal life he taught a crude torm oi evolution.
Zeller calls him “the earliest precursor ol Darwin.” Consult Ritter,

Phil.',1st series. 717. triquetris: Sicily was often characterized
irom its peculiar shape by Greeks and Latins alike.

718. aeq. lom: Several oi the earlier Greek writers use the term
Ionian Guli (Ἰόνιος κόλπος) as synonymous with Adriatic. The later
geographers considered the Ionian Sea as extending along the south
coast ol Italy, including the entrance oi the Adriatic, and reaching on
the one hand as lar as Greece, on the other to Sicily. The Latin writ-
ers, generally, use the term in this latter sense. See Smith, ‘Dict oi
Geog.' art. lenirem Mare. 719. glaucis: Greek γλαυκός. The
first conception oi the word was that ol ‘flamiug,' ‘bright’ But later
it referred to color, usually a shade oi olive-green. Trans. ‘ green!-

the small craft and poor art oi ancient sailors this whirlpool seems
to have furnished just grounds oi alarm. The Homeric poems indi·
