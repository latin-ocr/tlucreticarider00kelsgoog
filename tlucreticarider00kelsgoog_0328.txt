all uneompounded matter. . . . Now ii compound bodies are so very
hard as we find some ot them to be, and yet are very porous and con-
- sist ot parts which are only laid together, the simple particles which
are void of pores and were never yet divided must be much harder.
For such hard particles being heaped together can scarce touch one
another in more than afew points, and therefore must be separable
by much less iorce than is requisite to break a solid particle whose
parts touch in all the space between them without any pores or inter·
stices to wealren their cohesion.” Emerson represents nature as
sayingt-
“No ray is gone, no atom worn,
My oldest force is old as new,

And the fresh mse on yonder thorn
Gives back the bending heavens in dew.”

Suppose there is no rimie to the divisibility os matter; still there are
elements not as yet reduced, os which all things that exist are cmposed.
But these, unless indestructible, could not have withstood the forces os dis-
solutior from infinite past time (577·583). All nature is under the rergn
of law. This could nothe is there were notin matter elements incapable

qs change or decay ( 584-598).

579. superare := superesse. 580. clueant : = sint; cf, 449.
582. discrepat: ‘it is inconsistent,' ie. with the assumption that
matter is infinitely divisible. The argument is a kind oi reductio
ad absurdum, in which, however, the conclusion is not directly stated,
but may be readily supplied. - 584. generatim: seen. to 20.
585. quid . . . queant: queo and possum are often used absolutely in
the sense oi qu. facere or agere, pos. fac. or agere. In construing quid
and the like in such cases, instead of supplying fluere, as is often done,
it is better to consider them as adverbial acc. A like constr. is met
with in other languages. For the English cf. Browning ‘A'Death in
the Desert,' “ Lower than God, who knows all and can all ;” Bacon,
‘Essay on Great Plaee,’ “the best condition is not to will, the second
not to can; ” Shakspere ‘Hamlet,’ ‘⁴ The French, who can well on
horse-back.'’-ioedera naturai: the conception ot law. universal,
