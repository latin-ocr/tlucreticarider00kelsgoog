LUCRETIUS As A PHILOSOPHER Ἴ xlvll

like his, is largely ethical.¹ Their psychology agrees with his, at
least negatively, in denying the intuitions. Their theory of the
supreme good is at bottom the same, though arrived at in a
somewhat different way. The view oi man’s development in
civilization and the origin oi institutions set forth by Lucretius
anticipated important modern theories, which are by no means
confined to the doctrines of materialistS, but which, in part
at least, have been confirmed by the late investigations of
archaeologistS‚ and are generally accepted.²

All that is most valuable and suggestive in Lucretius’ doctrine
of the atom has its counterpart in modern science3 and the
atomic Materialism oi the day, stripped oi what belongs not
alone to it but to science in general, to theistic as well as to
atheistic and agnostic theories oi the universe, is precisely
Lucretius’ doctrine oi the nature of things, less the blunders in
fact and method unavoidable in the state oi knowledge of his
time. Great as is the scientific value of the doctrine oi evolu-
tiou as a working hypothesis in investigation‚ as a convenient
system oi classification for related facts oi the organic world,
when applied to the explanation oi the¹ universe with no God
it breaks down utterly. The materialistic evolution of our time,
then, is simply the Materialism of Lucretius, wrought over in
. accordance with the scientific methods and adapted to the scien-
tific knowledge oi our day. Subjected to the scrutiny oi careiul
criticism‚ it is found to be not a whit nearer to a settlement of
the fundamental questions ot existence than the system oi the
Roman poet.
