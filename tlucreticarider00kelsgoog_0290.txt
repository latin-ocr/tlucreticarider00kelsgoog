Greek poets, who represented him as armed with arrows and torches.
See Theocritus, Id. 23, and ci. Ov. Trist. 5, 1, 22. 35. cervice:
ie. Martis. -reposta: lor reposita, ‘thrown back.’ It has been con·
jectured that in this description the poet had in mind some painting,
perhaps one ot those that formed part ot the decoration ot temples.
36. visus: ior omlos. 37. Order oi trane. et spiritus (illius) re·
supini pendet ex tuo ore. 38. hunc: governed by circum in cir·
cumfuse ,· szaoer is used adverbially: ‘shcd thysell about him and
above! 39. loquellas: the suffix -ela is in good mss. written ella
when the preceding syllable is short. Thus ldqudb, querella is a better
spelling than loquela, quercla, commonly given in the dictionaries.
On the other hand, we should write leitila, suddila. See Roby, 177, ²3
Lachmann, n. to Lucr.3, 1015. 40. incluta: ‘glorious ¹; an epi-
thet rarely applied to a divine being. Lucr. uses it also with refer·
ence to Epicurus (3, Iol and Memmius (5, 8).

41-43. Various conjectures have been made regarding the time to
which these lines refer. That oi Munro is the most likely to be
correct; he thinks “that Lucr. was writing these lines towards the
close oi 695, or four years before his death, when Caesar was consul,
and had formed his coalition with Pompey. Memmius was then
praetor designatus, in fierce opposition to Caesar, and at that time
on the side oi the Senate with Cicero, and doubtless Lucretius.
There was almost a reign oi terror.” 4ῐ. hoct interpret from
ll. 24-5· 42. Memmi: for the form see n. ou 11 savoeu'.
43. desse: = deesse ; e -Ι- e is often contracted to ἰ. So in syn·
copated periects, as delerant for delevimmt, deleerunt. So generally
derat, dest for deerat, deest. Cf. 1, 711, derrasse for deerrasse. 1113,
· 861 deerraremt both vowels are retained, but are scanned as one.
44—4d The six lines printed here in the old editions = 2, 646-651.
, Isaac Vossius was the first to notice that they were inserted here to
show the inconsistency oi the poet in addressing a divinity at the
beginning of the work in which he maintains that ‘every nature of
’ the gods must in itseli oi necessity enjoy immortality in deepest peace,
far removed and withdrawn from concerns oi ours; ior free srom
every pain, from dangers free, powertul in its own resources, in noth·
ing neediul oi us, it is neither won over by favors nor stirred by
anger? Lachmann and Munro agree that aiter 43 a few lines have
been lost that furnished the transition to what follows. In them Mem·

, mius must have been addressed.
