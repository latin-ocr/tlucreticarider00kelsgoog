Ῑ. LUCRETIUS As· Α ΜΑΝ.

Or the lite of Titus Lucretius Carus nothing is known with
certainty. No allusion to it is found iu his poem, while in
the Latin writers there are only two passages bearing upon it.
Jerome1 assigns the year oi his birth to Β. c. 943 and says of
him that he became insane by the administration oi a love-
potion, and that ‘aiter he had composed, in the intervals of his
madness, some books which Cicero afterwards corrected, he
killed himself in his forty-iourth year.² Donatus, in his lite oi
Vergil, remarks that on the day ou which Vergil assumed the
toga virilis (Oct. 15,-B. c. 5 5) ‘it happened that the poet Lucre-
tius died.’ Between the two statements there is discrepancy.
Either Lucretius died before h'e reached his forty-fourth year,
or the date of his birth must be put earlier than 94.

The De Rerum Natura was evidently given to the world in
an unfinished state.² The completion oi it, as in the case oi
the Aeneid‚ was probably prevented by the poet’s death. Now
from one of Cicero’s letters to his brother,³ written in the earlier
partui 54, it is clear that they were both familiar with the poem.
At that time it was likely already published, or being copied for
circulation. This seems to confirm the statement oi Donatus.
ln the absence of further evidence we may suppose that Lucre-
tius died in the year 55. If Jerome was correct in fixing his
