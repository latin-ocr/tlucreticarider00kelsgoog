xlii INTRODUCTION

of combination they assumed manifold shapes of atoms‚ by
means of which these could become entangled and united in
all kinds of things. The Epicureans rejected the law ot neces·
sity and all final cause, supposed that atoms move downward in
empty space at the same rate, and assigned the occasion of
atoms combining to the sels-movement oi some from their course.
In this, without knowing it, they were really attributing psychic
properties to the amm, and showed the influence of the old
hylozoistic conception of matter. Although they utilized this
voluntary power ol the atom only in explaining the lreedom of
the will, believing that everything in nature goes on rigidly in
. obedience to law, the principle thus introduced was not lost
sight ol, but wras carried to its fullest application in the gradual
spiritualization ol the atom. lt was enlarged upon by Bruno‚
in the doctrine that “the elementary parts of all that exists are
the minima or monads‚ which are to be considered as points,
not absolutely unextended‚ but spherical; they are at once
psychical and material.’' It permeates the system of Gas-
sendi, who, though he clai-med simply to revive Epicureanism‚
“ascribed to the atoms force and even sensation.’'1 lt found a
complete and final realization in the monadology of Leibnitz. For
in opposition to Spinoza’s doctrine oi one universal substance
with the attributes of thought and extension‚ Leibnitz assumed
a plurality oi elementary forms which he made out to be in·
divisible points or penicles, “punctual unities,’' qualitatively
different, each having a soul ot its own and bearing to the sum
of all a fixed relation in a system of universal harmony. As he
emphasized the spiritual side oi these psychic atoms or monads‚
his tendency was idealistic; and his doctrine marks a transition
from Materialism to Idealism. Bruno, Gassendi, and Leibnitz
accepted the Christian conception ol God, but seem to have
found it adifficult matter to reconcile this with their philosophy.
Bacon, as it has already been remarked, adopted Democritus'
conception of the atom, which was accepted also by N ewton.
