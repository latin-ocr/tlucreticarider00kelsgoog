528. plagis: blows, or impact of atoms, and masses, held a very
important place in the Epicurean philosophy, both in the explanation
oi the natural processes ol growth and decay and in the doctrine of
sense-perception. 531. See 485 et seq. 5321 conlidi: ‘crushed
together,’ ‘crushed in.’¹ 533. bina: ‘into two parts,’ ‘in two’;
rarely used as here without a substantive. 534. manabile: found
only here ; :penetrale 537. tam: for eo, to correspond with qno.
-his rebus: i.e. umore, frigore, igni, the three great disintegrating
agencies. Amodernphysicist would add electricity. 540, fuis·
set: the imper. tense might have been expected, as indestructibility
is an essential, ever-present quality of matter, ‘ if matter were not,’ etc.
But the plup. is more logical, the implication being, ‘it matter from
infinite past time had not been,’ etc. In the expression of general
truths, however, the Latin tense-idiom is at variance with the English.
For the thought cf. Epicurus in Diog. Laert. 10, 24, 55 ‘It is necessary
that something remain indestructible that all things may not be re·
duced into nonexistence) 543. supra: ¹50 (where see n.) etseq.
546 quo : :in quae. 548. solida. . . simpl: ‘solid singleness,’ a
phrase often used by Lucr„ by which he forcibly suggests not simply
the· impenetrability, but also the individuality, as it were, the dis-
tinct separate existence of the atoms. Ι 549. aevom: ‘eternity'
This word is used by Lucr. also to express limited time, as below
553 aevo priore ‘the past‚' 564 aevi ⁸ nte-span: ‘age'

If there were not a set limit to the breaking up and destructslsn,sy¹
matter, before tln's it ruossld have been so fizr reduced that all grosutls wossld

an infinitesuture could not repair tlte wreck osan infinite past ( 5 51-564).
Again, while it is seen hmo with voidsrom inds'uisitle particles soft things

551. Denique: as in 199 where see n. 554. acer. temp:
‘within a fixed time! “ 555. summum . . . auctum: ‘reach its
utmost growth oi being) auctum is Munro's emend. ior finem, which
is obviously wrong, for finis elsewhere in Lucr. is iem , and besides
here does not suit the sense. Lachm. reads conceptum summa aetatis
pervadere fim's. 557. diei: ‘length’ ‘period' depends on aetas
‘duration,' and is limited in turn by tempon’s. Munro‚ however, says
