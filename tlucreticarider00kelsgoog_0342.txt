probabilities it may be shown that, with the requisite number oi throws
oi the letters, any verse oi the Iliad will be not only a possible, but
even a necessary result. For it is a possible combination, inasmuch
as it already exists3 in the shiiting oi letters, in infinite time, all pos·
sible combinations will appear. The universe, likewise, is a possible
combination, ior it exists. Granted an infinite number ol atoms
moving in infinite space through infinite time; all possible combina-
tions, ol which this universe is one, must result ; further, in the
numberless combinatione it might be an accident oi this world-com·
bination that, by a balancing oi forces owing to a union oi atoms
moving in different directions, it might endure for a time; it is
known, too, that this universe, at least the part with which we are
iamiliar, is undergoing gradual change‚—is then in its present form
by no means permanent. But even granting to materialists that by
a chance swirl oi atoms during infinite time the universe as it stands
could come into existence; they are not a whlt less dependent on a
Final Cause. Whence did the atoms get their shapes, so that it is
possible ior thern to combine? Whence did they receive the impulse
oi motion,which must be postulated in order to bring about any result
whateverl-tor dead matter cannot move itselt. As the Stoic, Mani-
lius, put it (Astron. i. 490-1) :-

quis credat tantas operum sine numine moles
ex minimis, caecoque creatum loedere mundum?

The modern reasoner oi materialistic tendencies, however, takes
refuge in Agnosticism. Thus, Tyndall says (⁴ Frag. of Sci’ p. 421) ε
‘¹ Ii you ask him (the materialistl whence is this ¹ Matter ' oi which
we have been discoursing, who or what divided it into molecules,
who or what impressed upon thern this necessity oi running into or·
ganic forms-he has no answer.” But there must be some one to
cast the letters the requisite number ol times before the verse oi the
Iliad can appear3 so there must be some power to set whirllng
through immensity those atoms which, in infinite time, passing into
all possible combinatione, might have produced this one. See nn.
