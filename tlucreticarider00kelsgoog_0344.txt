ἔκ τῶν ὅμοιομερῶν μικρῶν σωμάτων rb πᾶν συγκεκρίσθω. Other
examples are cited by Zeller, ut sup. p. 334-5. 834. quom: anti-
classical form oi aem, indicating its derivation from the pronominal
root KVA, Lat. qui; probably an old accusative. mm is the more
common form in the Mss. of Lucretius; quom, in those of Plautus
and Terence. 836. hic: i.e., Anaxagoras3 subject of putot below.
837. viscus: the singular is rare; it occurs again 3, 7193 3, 266.
Neue gives other passages where it is found, ‘Formenlehre' i. 447-8.
-sanguen ι -- sanguinem a neuter form was developed by the side
of the masc„ but went out of use in the classical period. 843. Anax.
taught that by the mixture of different kinds of substances there is
made up a universe without void. 844. See n. to 830. 846. illi:
Empedocles etc. ; see 734 etseq.

848. si . . . sunt: ‘if (those really) are first-beginnings.' 849.
sunt: for constant. After atque orac expressing comparison, ‘iham'
‘as,' the verb is usually omitted. Cf. 846 atque illi. 85ο. Anax,
however, held that the perficies, though divisible to infinity, were
imperisbable. 852. leti etc: cf. the Eng. expression, ‘in the very
jaws of death! 855. manifesta := φαινόμενα in its philosophical
use, ‘evident to the senses’ So 2, 867; 3, 3533 andin other places.

860. scire licet: frequent in Lucr.; ‘you are to know' After 860
doubtless a line has been lost. Lambinus thus supplies its place,
well continuing the argument:-
