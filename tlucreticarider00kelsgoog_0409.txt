tearing sods to pieces. 209. pressis aratris: ‘hy pressing down
the plow‚’ a very important operation in ancient plowing on account
of the rude structure of the tool, and hence often referred to in char·
acterizing the toil of the farmer. κιο-Π. Cf. 1, 211—2. 211. ci·
mus: supply res. 213. et tamen: see n. to 1, 1050. 216. imbris:
nom. pl. 220. morbos: the ancient like the modern Romans

mulium aliud ad lacrimas el has protinus vr'tae prancipio; also Job, ch.
33 edd. compare Lactantius 3, where 327 is quoted and the thought

‘⁴ Thou knowest, the first time that we smell the air

Wewawl,andcry; . ..
When we are born, we cry that we are come

To this great stage oi rools.'’

Kant remarks (‘Anthrop. 11. E, Hart. viii. 652) “that no creature
except modern man has the habit of entering upon life with a cry.
He believes that even in man this betraying and enemy-attracting cry
cannot originally have occurred—that it belongs to domestic life,
without our knowing through what co-operating causes such a devel-
opment has taken place.'’ See Lange, ‘Hist¹ of Materialism’ iii. 96

235 etseq. See n. to 1103 principio has no logical relation with the
preceding, but without the intervening passage would join on well after
109. 235-6. Cf. n. to 1, 6 coeli. In this mention of earth, air, and
fire he often expresses himself with poetic tautology. For animae see
n. tor, 715; for vapores, n. to 1, 491. 237. videtur: seen. to 1,
726. 246. principiale: found only here; pr. aliq. tem. ‘some time
