ch. 17 c(2). cf. Epicurus in Diog. Laert. 10, 27, 12 5 ‘Therefore the
most dread-inspiring ol all evils, death, is nothing to us; ior when we
exist death is not present to us, and when death is present, then we are
nbt in existence. It does not concern, then, either the living or the
dead; for to the living it has no existence, and the dead do not them·

and Sext. Pyrrh. 3, 229): ‘0 θάνατος οὐδὲν πρὸς ἡμᾶς· rb γὰρ διαλυθέν, duar-
σθητεῖ· rb δὲ ἀναισθητοῦν, οὐδὲν πρὸς ἡμᾶς. 832. aegri: gen. after
nil. 833-842. Just as we felt no dread or pain when all the world
was trembling with the struggle between Rome and Carthage‚ so in the

temporaries, and marked the most critical period oi the Roman state Χ
up to his time. Λ 836. luere: supply harninesssutrorum: i.e.,

subjunctive, the indic. here is very forcible. 845. comptu: ‘the
