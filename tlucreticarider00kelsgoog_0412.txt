which it is thought Lucr. followed. 323. deminui: i.e.‚ crem res
anget alitque. With the thought of 322-3, ci. 3, 517-8.

backfar beyond tire tales of Thebes and Troy. Dost tlrink that, though
tlte world bas always been, beat, eartqunabes‚ or floods destroyed tlte race

n. to 1, ²3 5. 332-5. Guyau finds in Lucr. the poet oi progress;
cf. ‘Morale d'Epicure et ses rapports avec les doctrines contempo-
raines,’ p. 159: ‘Without doubt already there have been found in
Lucretius a large number oi modern ideas, as those of evolution and
oi natural selecti0n; but that oi human progress‚ moral, intellectual,
and industria] progress‚ which he has so clearly expressed, has up to
the present hardly been noticed. Still, the fifth book of Lucretius has
the most striking analogy with the “ Esquisse des progrds de l'esprit
humain,’' drawn in our day by Condorcet.' 336. cumprimis:
see n. to 1,130. 336-7. Previous to Lucu, however, C. Ama·
tinius had treated in bad prose the physical doctrines of Epicurus;
Zeller from Cic. Tusc. Disp. 4, 3,' 6 fixes his date “not long after the
philosophie embassy oi 156 Β. c.'’ cf. Cic. Acad. 1, 2, 5 uides autem

count oi their style that Lucr. passes over in contempt the services oi
Amafinius and Rabirius (or Rabirius) in popularizing the Epicurean
philosophy; at any rate, their books were much read, as is evident
brom Cic. Tusc. Disp. 4, 3, 6 cuins (Amafinii) libris editas commota rnul-
