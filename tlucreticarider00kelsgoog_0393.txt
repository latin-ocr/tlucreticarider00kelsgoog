894-6. Cf. the stanza oi Gray’s ‘Elegy'z-

‘¹ For them no more the blazing hearth shall bum,
³ Or busy housewiie ply her evening care ;
No children run to lisp their sire’s retum,
Or climb his knees, the envied kiss to share-'³

' Edd. here compare also Georg. 2, 523-4 Interea dulces pendent circum
oscula nati ; Casta pudicitiam servat domus. 896. praeripere: the
infinitive, expressing purpose, is sometimes iound aiter a verb oi mo-
tion in Plautus, Terence, and Lucretius, and rarely in the Augustan
poets. 897. lactis flor: ‘prosperous doings’· 898. misero
misere: misero is drawn from its natural position near tibi, for the
sake of the assonance, of which Lucr. is so fond. Ci. nn. to 666, 779.
899. dies: i.e., mortis. 900. illud: seen. to 1,80. 906. cinefac-
tum: ‘turned to ashes ’according to Nonius, a significationwhich Lach-
mann decides cannot be correct. Munro renders ‘tum to an ashen
hue ’ς the meaning seems to be that the bereaved stood weeping near
the funeral pyre and gazed on the body as it was gradually consumed,
taking on the color oi ashes-busto: the funeral pyre; connected ,
with com-hu-ro. Bustum, says Festus, proprie dicitur locus in quo

912. discubuere: i.e.,r'n conviviis. 913. inum. ora: chaplets oi
leaves and tlowers were worn at the drinking-bouts as an antidote
against intoxicati0n; ora, ‘brows' 9¹4· homullis: with the
diminutive is associated the idea of ‘insignificant‚'‘ of no account!
The thought is, ‘enjoyment is brici, hence take advantage oi it '3 like
“eat drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die‚” the motto oi most
Epicureans. This doctrine Lucretius, true to the old Roman philos-
ophy of life, visits with stern censure. llerein he stands in marked
contrast with Horace, who would fill each day with pleasure3 see Od.
