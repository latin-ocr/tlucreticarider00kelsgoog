tute, giving either tutemet or tutimet, — both, however, rare. —vatumt
Munro’s explanation 01 the word is the best. According to him vates
was ‘⁴ the oldest name 101 poets,’' which later ⁴⁴ 1011 into complete con·
tempt, and was discarded 101 poeta. Virgil and succeeding writers
made vates once more a name 01 honor, and denoted by it an inspired
bard, -something higher than poeta. With Lucr. here and in 109 it is
a term 01 contempt, to denote apparently singers 01 old prophecies
and denouncers 01 coming ills.'’ 103. terriloquis: found only
here; see 11.οη 1, 275 silvifragis. -desciscere etc: this and the pre·
ceding line probably do not imply any distrust 01 Memmius’ courage
on the part 01 the poet, but through him are intended to reach and with
the following lines remove the natural timidity 01 many readers. Mern-
mius‚ however, as already remarked, seems not to have been inclined
toward Epicureanism. 105. somnia etc: ci. the words 01 the

acc. aiter the neuter 01 the gerundive with est. This constr. is very rare
except in Lucr. and Varro; it resembles the use 01 the acc. aiter ver-
