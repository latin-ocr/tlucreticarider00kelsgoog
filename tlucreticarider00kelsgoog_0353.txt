288 LUCRETIUS [1. 1033-

1033. summissa gens: ct. 8. The expression implies the springing
of living things from the earth, explained at length 5, 771 etseq.
1034. vivant: = durent by poetic license, Munro thinks. The an·
cients generally seem to have supposed the heavenly bodies endowed
with life. See n. on 5, 523. 1036. ex infin: asin 1001, where
see n. 1038. Ct. 194. 1041. viai: gen. 01 separation after
aversa,·aGreek constr. A. 243, s, Rem.; H.410,v.4 1043. quae·
eumque: trans. as if qnae; but quaecumq. has a peculiar force, irn-
plying that it covers in entirety, altogether, that which it represents.
1044. enirn: ‘indeed’ ‘it is true'; beware of always trans. enim
‘lon’ 1044. part. mon: i.e., keep a portion of the sum ol

pieces. 1⁰5⁰· et tamen: the expression is elliptical. The
meaning in iull is ‘and lthough what I have said is true) yet.’

suppose that there are antipodes r's rank solly ; in infinite space there can
he no centre, andis there could he, things would not necessarily tend toward
r't any more than be repelled from it. Further, there eon be neplaee where
hodres lose their weight and are able to be sustained by void 10 52-1082.
