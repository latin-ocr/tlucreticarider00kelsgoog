784-7o7. Repeated with slight change 5,128-141. 787. quic·
quit :quicque; ct. 1, 289. ⁴ 79⁰· posset . . . prius: ‘for this
(which follows) would be much more likely to happen than that'
(the existence 01 1111 soul apart from the body). Lachmann reads
Qecr'dsi posset enim? Multo prius etc. Suppose the mind, instead of
being located in the heart, were to be placed in the head or shoul-
ders or any other part, still it would be in the body. 793. vase:
see n. to 440. 801. putare (ntortale ct eternum) posse consentire ct
sangi etc. mutuo has an adverbial force, as several times in Lucr.
See Roby, 1096-7. 805-818 = 5, 351—363: “ They here interrupt
the argument, andare, of course, one oi the many glosses with which
some reader has wished either to explain or relute the poet by
quoting his own verses for or against him, as the case may be.'’
This passage has often been rechoned the twenty-seventh argument
against the immortality of the soul, making the following the twenty·
eighth.

(27) But tlte saul neay be thought immortal because it is procecedsrom
destructive agenctes,· on the contrary, it suffers not merely from tlte ills ιγ’
cla body, bat also from cares andsears and other troubles os its own.

819-829.

819. habendast: supply animo. 823. After this verse a vs.
seems to have been lost, which Lachmann thus supplies: Multa tamen
tanguntam'mom rezola, rnulta pericla. 824. praet. en. quam quod:
‘For besides that.’ A like tmesis oi praeterquam occurs in Cic. De
Leg. 3, 19, 45.-aegret: found only here.

2. Conclusions based on the soul's mortality.
830-1094.

( 1) Since tlte soul is mortol, death c's natktagta us ; far tbefuturc will
be to us as thepast was before our birth. Evenif the soecl live aster death
wc sball not, since aur personality is made up by tlce anion of soul and
body. And r'f bereafler sometime tlce otoms of our body and saul shall so

collect os to recalet a lcaing form, we shall not exist, because the thread of
iderrtity will bave been broken. 8 30-869.
