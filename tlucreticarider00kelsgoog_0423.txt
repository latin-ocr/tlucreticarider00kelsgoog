585. hinc: ‘from the earth‚' as hinc in 5843 the line should be taken
in close connection with 590-1; 586-9, introducing a comparison, are
parenthetical. 589. alteram etc: provided the flickering ot a
fire is seen clearly and its heat perceived, the size seems to vary very
little,- in appearing either larger or smaller‚- whether one be near
at hand or tar off, in proportion to the distance. The comparison is
copied from Epicurus; see Diog. Laert. 10, 91 ‘ But taken by itself, the
sun may be a little larger or a little smaller than it appears, or of the
same size that it seems to be; tor just so it is with fires among us,
which are seen at a distance and perceived (directly) by the senses.’
