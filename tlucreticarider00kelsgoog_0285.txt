direct exercise of power-quoniam etc.= this clause (often misun-
derstood) stands, in thought as in position, closely connected with cora·
celebras. - animantum ι stems in i preceded by a dental‚ except those
of one syllable, are sometimes in the poets found with gen. pl. in ·um.
The reason may lie in the requirements of the verse, though parens
and a few others have the gen. pl. in -um in prose. Cicero wrote ani-
manlium. · Cf. n. to 3, 573. 5. exortum: ‘rising up' into exist-
ence. Exoriri is often employed by Lucr. in this philosophic sense.-
lumina: poetic use of pl. where prose and the English idiom would
prefer the sing. Perhaps there is in the pl. a distributive force that
brought before the Latin mind the conception of rays. ¹

6. caeli, 7. tellus, 8. ponti: the three grand divisious of the uni-

' verse, frequently met with in classica] and even in modern writers.

By considering caelum as composed of ae'r and aether, the atmos·
phere and the pure upper air, the poet elsewhere assumes the four·
fold structure of the world recognized by philosophers and poets
alike. This last division is closely connected with the idea of the
four primal elements, earth, water, air, and fire, which after the time
of Empedocles, held so important a place in cosmological specula-

tions. Ovid also, in his account oi the creation (Met. 1, 1-124), first
mentions the three parts of the universe, then the four. Cf. 2-3,

above; 5, 416-17, 449, et scq.; 1, 714 et seq. 7. suavis: Lucr, as
the other Latins of the classical period, wrote the acc. pl. of lstems
in ·cs or-is indifferentiy. The ending -eis, rarely found except in Prae·
Augustan inscriptione, was incorrectly printed in old editions. Cf.
frugaserenas above—daedala: the epithet may refer either to the
earth’s power of manifold productiori, orto its variegated appearance
resulting therefrom. Edd. quote here the explanation of ‘Paulus
ex Fest0‚' p. 68, 6, daedalum a varietate rerum artt‘ficabrumque ezi'ctam
csse apud Lucretium terram, apatd Ennium Minervam, apud Vergilium
Circen, fietile est intellegere, cum Graece δαιδάλλειν sagmfieet variare.
Tr. : ‘manifold of works,’ a meaning that well suits the active force of
summittit. Cf. 5, 234 natura daedala rerum; 4, 551 verberum daedala
lingeea. 8. rident: afavorite word of our poet. Cf. 5,1004-5, and n.
10. April as the first month of Sprlng was regarded hythe Romans
as sacred to Venus. So in all ages spring-time and Love have been
associated. Cf. the graceful lines of Tennyson in ‘Locksley Hali!-
