ducts ol sense-perception and the formation ol judgments the

assumed immediate knowledge ol things, and found the only
source of knowledge rn experience.

2. Lucretius' Theory ol the Universe.

There are two elemental parts os the universe, matter and
void. All things are made up ol these. Void is everywhere
“ where matter is not; matter and void are mutually exclusive.²
Matter is composed of atoms. These are perlectly solid, with·
out beginning or end or any possibility ol change in, nature,
minute beyond the limit of vision, and known only by the mind.⁸
The atoms differ in torm; they are rough, smooth‚ hooked,
round, larger, smaller; but the various shapes are limited in
number, though there is an infinite number ol atoms oi each
shape. They differ also in weight. The movement of atoma is
immeasurably swilt, and always downward, because of their
gravity, unless impeded. Everything that exists contains void
as well as atoms, since only these are devoid of empty space.⁴
Color, beat, cold‚ moisture‚ dryness, all the properties that cau be
detected inthings, are accidents oi the combinations of atoms; the
atoms themselves have no properties save extensior, hardness,
weight, and motion. All combinations are unstable, continually
changing. Dissolution awaits everythlng.⁶

The universe is without limit in any of its dimensions, and
has no centre. There is no end to space, and atoms are num-
berless. There is an infinite number ol worlds.⁶ As the atoms
tall in infinite space, some by their own power swerve to one
sidel These become involved with others, forming awhirling
