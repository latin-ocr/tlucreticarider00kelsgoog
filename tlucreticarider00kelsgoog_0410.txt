Cic. N. D. 1, 8, 20 quae est enim coagmentatio non dissolubilis? aut qnid
est, cneus principium aliquod sit, nihil est extremum? The argument
of this paragraph is precisely the same as that oi Epicurus, who “says
that the worlds are perishable because their parts undergo change '⁹
(μεταβαλλόντων τῶν μερῶν) ; see Diog. Laert. 10, 74. ’

(ι) Earth is neartal ‚· some φ’ it, parched by the scen aud tradden by
the feet, is scattered by the wind ,· sorore is worn away by strenuos.
It is the mother arrd at thesaure time the common taneb of all
things. 247-260.

(2) Water, too, is perishable ; the sea, streams, ared springs are always
oucrflawing with new supplies, while the ssim is ever the same,·
for wlnd and sun take away a part, and a part through the
carth finds its way back to the sources of rs'oers. 261-272.

(3) The air, ls'kewise, is horcrly changing; far into it goes whatever
passer off from things, and unless lt gave back matter to things
they would all be turned into air. 27 3-280.

(4) A nd fire also; for the sun is always sending forth new light, arrd
that which storosfrom ilperishes. as when a cloud comes between
it and us thc lign below disappears ; so lamps are constantly sup
plying the placeas ald leghtwith neso; the same usust be thought
trice of the heoueuly bodies. 281-30 5.
