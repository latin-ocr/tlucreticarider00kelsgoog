even in the time of Lucr. and Cicero is evident from Hom. Od. 17, 218
ὥς αἰεὶ τὸν ὁμοῖον ἄγει θεὸς ὡς τὸν ὁμοῖον, and Plae Phaedr. 240 c. For
the thought oi 443 et seq. cf. the account of world-formation by Epicu·
rus in his letter to Pythocles, Diog. Laert. 10, 89-90: ‘suitable .
seeds (πεμμάτων, i.e., ‘atoms ') flowing irorn one world, or from sev·
eral, or trorn the spaces between worldS, little by little torm a collec-
tion, an organized whole, which undergoes changes perchance‚ and
receives increase until there has been produced a complete and
enduring combination, to which successive additions may be made,'
etc. 446. Cf. Ov. Met. 1, 21-3:-

hauc deus et melior litem natura diremitt
uam eaelo terras et terris abscidit undas

et liquidum spisso secrevit ab aere caelumr
quae postquam evolvit etc.

It is worthy ot note that Ovid, in his account oi the evolution ot the
world from chaos, uses the word evolvere. Cf. Macr. 6, 4, 24· 447.
sorsum: see nto 3, 631. 448. aetheris: by aether Lucr. some·
times means the sky (see 1, 2 50 and n.),sometimes the enveloping fire·
belt (ct. n. to 1, 73); this last he identifies with the pure upper air,
which, in the popular beliefs as well as in several of the philosophie
systcms, was recognized as a fourth part of the world or universe ancl
a fourth clement. GeneraHv, however, Lucr. holds to the three-told
division of the world, which he mentions and emphasizes again and
again. See n. to 1, 6-8.

got ‘ entangled ' because of their irregular shapes, for which see 2, 333
et seq. ,· explained by Cic. N. D. 1, 20, 54 . . . atomorum quae interiecto
