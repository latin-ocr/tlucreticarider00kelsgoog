infinite number oi moving atoms, infinite space and infinite time,a
universe like the present could or would result, belongs properly to
the Calculus oi Probabilities. See n. to 823-6; Janet, ‘ Final Causes,
App. x.‚ i.; Burr, ‘Doctrine oi Evolution,’ Second Series,’ sect. 63
Charpentier, ‘Me'moire sur la logique du probabis! The position oi
Lucr. is essentially that oi modern materialistic evolution, whose
“claim is that a cloud oi atoms, endowed with definite spheres oi
attraction and repulsi0n‚ is able to work out all the results which
seem to us to manifest intelligence and purpose.” See Bowne, ⁴ Re-
view oi Herbert Spencer,' p. 2343 cf. pp. 19-22. Spencer declares
that “this transformation of an indefinite, incoherent homogeneity into
adefinite‚ coherent heterogeneity, which goes on everywhere until it
brings about a reverse transformation, is consequent upon certain
simple laws oi iorce.'’ Still more outspoken is Haeckel, ‘Nat Hist.
oi Creation,’ ch. 1 (i. zoi: “ Whilst‚ then, we emphatically oppose the
vital or teleological view oi animate nature, which presents animal and
vegetable fomis as the productioris of a kind Creator, acting lor a
definite purpose, or oi a creative, natural force acting ior a definite
purpose, we must, on the other hand, decidedly adopt that view oi
the universe which is called the meckam'cal or causal. It no longer
occurs to physicistS, chemists, mineralogists, or astronomers to seek
to find in the phenomena which continually appear before them in
their scientific domain the action oi a creator acting ior a definite pur·
pose. They, universally, and without hesitation, look upon the phe·
nomena which appear in their different departments oi study as the
necessary and invariable effects oi physical and chemical forces
which are inherent in matter.'' Cfi Biichner, ‘Krait und Stoff'3

Theistic Theories,’ sect. 43 Lange, ‘Hist of Materialism,’ i. ¹39·
