mutation and mixture of resulting substances the world is made up3
but there is constant change from one state or form of matter to
another3 and at the close of a sured cycle of ages all things are re·
solved back again into the primal essence, -the universe becomes a
vast chaos of vvaving flame. Again‚ the process of transmutation and
the unstable equilibrium of oppositas in one substance will produce
another world; and so on through the innumerable cycles of eternity.
This theory of Heraclitus, with some changes, was adopted by the
Stoics as the basis of their physics. The best account of H. is
by Zeller, ‘Prae-Soc. Phil' vol. ii. Consult also Ueberweg, ‘Hist
of Phil! vol. i.; Ritter‚ ‘Hist of Anc. Phil! vol. i.; Lenes,
‘Biog Hist. of Phil! - quorumr a school of Heracliteans existed
for several generations after the death of H. But the reference
is here more particularly to the Stoics, whom Lucr. takes every
opportunity to attack. For the reason that in this discussion of
Heraclitus he is combating his most earnest opponents the poet
waxes far more ardent than in his later criticisms of Empedocles and
Anaxagoras. 639. obscuram linguam: the darkness of meaning
in the utterances of Heraclitus gained for him the epithetd σκοτεινάς <

by some that he did not wish to express himself clearly lest his vievvs,
being opposed to the religious ideas of the time, call down persecu·
tion upon him. But in the fragments of his writings that have come
down to us he is singularly outspoken. And while his obscurity ls
often alluded to hythe ancients, he is never charged by them with
intent to be obscure. Lucretius, indeed, rather pays him a compli· 7
ment by implying that he is difficolt to understand only to the ⁴ light· '
minded’ Greeks. Like the old man in Wordsworth‚ he coined his
thought in “phrase above the reach Of ordinary men.'' 640.
quamde: archaic for quam ‘than’ formed by adding the particle -de
found in ern-de, itt-de, and the like. taarnde is also found twice in the

vertereverba sometimes means to use words in unusual or wrong sense.
Here more likely the reference is to the arrangement3 ‘involved
