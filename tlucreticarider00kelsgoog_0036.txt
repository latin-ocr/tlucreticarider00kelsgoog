vortex, the beginning of a world. Thus the world in which we
are, originated. At first there was a chaos oi clashing and en·
tangled atoms. Then gradually came a differentiation into parts,
like gathering with like. The heaviest particles settled in a mass.
Out os this the lightest and smoothest were pressed‚ forced to
the outermost bounds, and there united in a close-voven, envel-
oping sphere‚ the aether. Beneath this the air spread out.
Midway between the aether and the earth the atoms heavier
than the one, yet lighter than the other, gathered, forming the
sun and moon3 some passing higher still made the stars. The
earth as it settled together grew rough in ridges and plains,
mountains and valleys‚ as the parts ot its surtace being ot
unequal density could not give way the same. Into the hollow
places the smoother atoms were pressed‚ making the sea.² The
earth is in the mid-region oi the world. Underneath it lies a
nature with which it is closely united, akin to the air above.
Its weight diminishes below, so that it rests in calm poise.²
Around it with unequal speed the heavenly bodies revolve iu
lateral orbits.³ The sun and the moon are ot the same size that
they seem to us to be.⁴ Our world, like allthings else, is
doomed to destruction.l <

In the explanation of natural phenomena it is idle to assign
but one cause, and declare that this must be the correct one;
for the trnth cannot be known. He that is wise will give sev·
eral causes, any one ot which will be adequate to account ior
the phenomenon under consideration without the aid of the
gods.⁶ Eclipses may be brought about by the interposition oi
some body that cuts off the stream ot light, or by the going out

os the fires of the sun and moon, or in other waysl Day and
night may result from the sun running his courses under the
earth and above, or from the waning ot its light through lack ot
