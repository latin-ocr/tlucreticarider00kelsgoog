ecee was the subject of many Greek works, in both prose and verse,
irom the time of Anaximander down. It stood as title probably to
the philosophie poem of Xenophanes, certainly to that of Parmeni-
des, and the most important one of Empedocles. Empedocles' περὶ
φύσεως both furnished a model and gave inspiration to our poet, who
in several places shows traces of its influence. See 1, 716 et seq,
and nn. Epicurus also left a treatise in thirty-seven books having
the same title. See Diog. Laert. 10, 17, 27. Fragments oi it are
extant in the work of Philodemus, deeiphered from the eharred rolls
discovered at Herculaneum. Moreover, prior to Lucretius, Amafinius
set forth in barbarous Latin the physical doctrines of Epicurus,
though under what title or titles is not known. On the whole, then,
the title de rerum natura being in harmony with the subjects chosen
for their works by his philosophie predecessors, probably suggested
itself to our poetas the one best suited to his theme 3 and thus was
not, as it has been asserted, taken direetly from Epicurus' περὶ od·
esea-pangere: first applied to the writing of poetry perhaps by
Ennius. See the famous epigram on himself given in Cic. Tusc. Disp.
1, 15, 34 (Vahlen’s edit. of Enn. p. 162) ln'c vestrum partxit maxima
sacta patrum. See n. to 1, 117. Cf. 1, 933; 4, 8.

26. Memmiadae: like Scipiadas (3, 1034), a word of irregular for-
mation, having a Greek patronymic termination added to a Latin
stem. Gaius Memmius, to whom Lucretius dedicateshis poem, and ,
of whom he speaks in terms of the sincerest regard‚ wasa prominent
figure in the politics of the time. The Memmian gens was of ple·
beian origin, and of little note till the Jugurthine war. About that time

·. Gaius Memmius, the grandfather of Lueretius’ friend, made himself
· famous by strenuous and unyielding opposition to the aristocratie
Ι party. He exposed its corruptions, impeached several of its lead·
2 ing men, and finally as candidate for the consulship met a violent
j death at the hands oi a mob led hy Satuminus,-the incident re·
ferreti to by Cic. in Cat. 4, 2. After this the name is often met with in
Roman annals till the close of the Republic. The Memmius referred
to here was a man of power, but utterly lacking in principle. The
date of his birth is not known; but he was plebeian tribune iu· 66, and
won distinction by opposition to the triumph demanded by Lucullus
³ returning victorious from the war with Mithridates, on the ground that
