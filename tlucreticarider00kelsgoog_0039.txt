xxxii INTRODUCTION

with thought fixed on the order and regularity manifest on every
hand, such a doctrine ol natural causes seemed mean and low
enough. So not seeing that behind law there must he a law·
giver, he stopped with the conception oi law itself. This satis·
fied the groping of his mind for a unifying principle that should
explain the mysteries oi natural phenomena. To it he con·
stantly appeals in setting forth causes. By means of it he
accounts for the regularity oi the seasous,l the alternation of
day and night,2 and manifold other things in which a certain
order is clearly to be seen. Yet Lucretius was no fatalist. He
spurns the old law of necessity to which the Atomists appealed.
By the swerving of the atoms as they fall in space, the eternal
chain of cause and effect is broken; momentous results follow.⁸
Herein he is justly charged with inconsisteucy. He tried to
pursue a middle course between inexorable fate and chaotic
polytheism. He found the beginning of a world in a fortuitous
swirl of atoms brought about by the unreflective seli-movement
ot some atoms out of their course. But the atoms were moving
straight downwards‚ because the law ol nature causes bodies to
fall unless hindered. They settled to different places tor the
same reason. Thus in accordance with natural law the world
was evolvecl, its changes go on, its end is fixed. Fixed barriers
too hem in organic existence with the invariability of types and
the survival of the fittest. In the presence oi the laws of nature
even man stands absolutely powerless3 sometimes they seem a
hidden force dasbing to nought his mightiest workS, foiling his
most gigantic efforts.4 Thus to Lucretius there seemed but
one break in the causal relations ol the universe. ¹This ex·
cepted‚ he held consistently and emphatically to the reign oi law.
Nature as the incarnation of law, as the tangible reality through

· which its operatious are manifest, in his thought took on the
attributes of personality; seemed a veritable being energizing
upon matter in space and time, directing the processes of pro·
