830. Anaxagorae: b. at Clazomenae, about 500 ne. Anax·
agoras taught that there is an indefinite number oi primitive sub·
mances, qualitatively different, corresponding to all the various kinds
oi matter. Thus, flesh is made up oi minute particles oi flesh, bone
oi particles oi bone, gold ol gold, and so forth. These particles are
underived and indestructible. They are not, however, atoms, ior they
are infinitely divisible. The lour elements he thought to be merely a
mixture of all kinds ol primitive particles; their “apparent simple·
ness he explains by saying that, on account oi the amalgamation ot
all possible determinate substances, not one of these is perceived in
its distinctive individuality, but only that is perceived in which they
all agree.” To explain the union oi these in living bodies, and the

creation and on-going ol the universe, Anaxagoras taught the exist·
enee oi a Νοῦς, an incorporeal, intelligent Force, acting upon matter

lrorn without. He was the first who grasped at the idea oi essential
difference between matter and spirit; at the conception also oi an
intelligent Final Cause. It is an error, however, to suppose that
Anaxagoras believed in the Νοῦς as a personality, as an infinite, all·
perfect God. See Zeller, ‘Prae-Soc. Phil' vol. ii.-hom0e0merian:
= ὁμοιομέρειαι, and so written in some MSS. and older edit.; ‘homoeo-
meria.' Anax. called his primitive particles πέμματα ‘seeds’ or χρόΓ
ματα ‘things'; ὁμοιομερῆ ‘ol like parts' does not occur in the frag-
ments oi Anax. extant, but is first found in Aristotle3 whether it or
ὁμοιομέρεια was used by Anax. is an open question. The latter term
is firstmet with in this passage, and seems to denote “the relation
which existed between the things in being and the particles, like in
kind, oi which they were composed,'' as suggesting the doctrine oi
simple substances composed oi parts infinitely small. In later Greek
writers nl ὁμοιομέρειαι is used in describing the system oi Anax, as by
Diog'. Laert. 2, 8 οὗτος ἔλεγε...ἇρχὰς δὲ τὰς ὁμοιομερείας·
καθάπερ γὰρ ἐκ τῶν ψνγμᾶτων λεγομένων rb χρυσὸν συνεστάναι, οὗτοι
