retain many traces of this e, intermediate between the a of the simple
verb and the later i.'’ 240. sensiferos: found only in Lucr. Cf. n.
to ι, 275. 241 etc. It would be hard to find an instance of more
utterly groundless speculation than here presented. “The difficulty of
fixing the exact seat of sensation is in the most important point com·
pletely evaded by the Epicurean system; and in spite of the immense
progress of physiology, the Materialism of the last century found itself
at precisely the same point. The individual atoms do not feel, or their
feelings could not be fused together, since void space, which has no
substratum, cannot conduct sensation, and still less partake of it. We
must, therefore, constantly fall back on the solution‚—the motion
of the atonis is sensation. Epicurus, and with him Lucretius, in vain
seeks to veil this point by sayiug that, besides the subtle atoms
‘that make up the three other parts of the soul,’ there is still a fourth
constituent associated with them, wholly without name, and of the
utmost fineness and mobility, which forms the soul of the soul. But
with regard to these subtlest soulatoms the difficulty still remains the
same as it also does for the vibrating hrain-filameuts of De la Met·
trie.’' Lange, ‘Hist of Materialism,' i. 146-7. To explain the origin of
sense or feeling, and the source of the impulse of voluntarymovement,
is a hard nut for materialists to crack. Epicurus and Lucr. are not
the only ones that have taken refuge in something unknown and
unknowable. 242. east: seentor. ιο. It has been suggested
that perhaps Epicurus derived his idea of this fourth essence from the
quintessence of Aristotle. 246. figuris: see n. to 190. First
the fourth clement or essence is stirred; this transfers motion and
feeling to the beat-clement, this in turn to the wind, the wind to the
air-element; hence blood, vitals, finally bone and marrow, receive the
impulse. “Epicurus appears, to have supposed, in sharp vcontrast
with our theory of the conservation of force, that a subtle body may
pass ou its own movement to a heavier, independently of the burk,
and this in turn to a still heavier3 so that the sum of mechanical
work done, instead of remaining stationary, goes on multiplying from
step to step.'’ Lange, utsupra. 247. motus: acc. 252. huc:
he.. to the seat of this fourth subtle clement of the soul. 256. ‘But
generally a stop is put to (these hurtful) motione on the surface, as it
were, of the body.’
