their form, to force its impulse of movement; who impressed
upon both matter and force a natural law, in accordance with
which the universe has been built up and is carried on, in the
out-working of a comprehensive divine plan. But the atheistic,
and agnostic thinkers, with the same inconsistency that charac-
terized Lucretius, starting with chance and without a lawgiver,
assume the reign oi law, and suppose that with this atonis and
space and force and time are adequate to account for all the,
facts and phenomena of the present order of things. The doc-
trine of the atom is just as consistent with a theistic as with an
atheistic theory oi the universe. Lucretius indeed personified,
deified nature. ln this he is followed by some modern mate·
rialists, while others seem to put evolution in the place of God,
and deify a process.1 ln assuming the eternity of matter and
the continuity oi motion, the infinity of time and space, and
numberless atoms, as essential conditions to the coming ol a
world into existence, Lucretius and the modern materialist are
atone. Ι.

Regarding the genesis of things, Lucretius loreshadows mod-
ern science in the nebular hypothesis. ln his account of the
beginning of the world, as in the modern doctrine, we have
the chaotic mingling of clashing and discordant-elements; the
formation of a world-nucleus; the gradual differentiation of parts
r composed of matter in states of unequal density. Here, how·
ever, the parallel ends. For the poet was giving range to his
imagination in a magnificent conception, adapted to his philoso-¹
phy from the old mythology, while the nebular hypothesis is
based upon a carelul examination of the properties and relations
ol the so-called elementary substances, framed in accordance
with the laws of force, and through experiment receives at least
a partial verification by analogy. ln his ideas about the heavenly
bodies and his explanations ol natural phenomena, moreover,
Lucretius is almost everywhere adrift.² With akeen interest in
what is now termed science, but with no true scientific method,
