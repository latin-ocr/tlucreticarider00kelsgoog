11. LUCRETIUS As A PHILOSOPHER.

(i.) Pmnosomrv suono run Rounws m Lucnurrus’ Turn„

Tne genius oi the Romans was adapted to practical‘rather
than artistic construction. They wrought out the greatest re·
sults and made the most valuable contributions to humanity in

¹ the domain of politics and law. For the arts, literature, and

philosophy, for all that has to do with the culture oi life as dis-
tinguished from its bare necessities‚ they were indebted to the
Greeks. The Greek masterpieces and verse-forms furnished
them models ior literary composition. Greek artists and sculp-
tors painted and carved ior them. Greek teachers gave them
instruction in music and the liberal arts. Finally, the imitation
oi the Greeks in many of the ways oi common liie became the
fashion. ln the contactos the two diverse forms oi civilization‚
theone characterized by power oi military and civil organization,
the other by the pre-eminent influence os the individual mind
and the development oi taste‚ that founded upon force prevailed
over the other only to be shaped by it. ‘Greece conquered‚

’ took captive her rude conqueror, and brought the arts to rustic

Latium.'1

When the Romans first began to have leisure and a taste for
speculation, the Greek systems had already reached their iullest
expansion. The rapid extension oi Roman territory under the
old Republican form oi government was then placing before
young men new political prizes to be won by personal power.
