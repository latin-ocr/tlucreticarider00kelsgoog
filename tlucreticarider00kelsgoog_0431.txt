366 LUCRETIUS [V. 793-

by the Pythagoream, StoicS, and many others, that the life of animals
is a part of the great universal life,-a fragment, as it were, of the
world-soul. The Epicureans were especially hostiie to the belief that
man has any spark of the divine in him,-

sive hunc divino semine fecit
ille opifex rerum, mundi melioris origo,
sive recens tellus seductaque nuper ab alto
aethere, cognati retinebat semina caeli. (Ov. Met. 1, 78-81.)

ct.2,1154-5. 794. nec ter. etc: in opposition to the view of
Anaximander, that the first life was generated by the heat of the sun
in the primal slime as the earth was becoming dry; and that “the
land animab, including man, had at first been fishes, and afterwards,
when they were able to develop themselves under their new shape,
they had corne on shore and throtvn off their scales.” See Zeller,
‘Prae-Soc. Phil.' i. 255-6. The anciful theory of the idealist‚ Oken,
is stri'kingly similar; see his ‘Physio-Philosophy,’ trans. by Tulk,
ξ 900 ct sep: “ Every organic has issued out of mucus; the primary

Light shines upon the salted sea and it lives.'' Diod. Sic. (3, 2)
says that the first men formed were the Ethiopians, because as the
ntoist earth dricd off ‘it was natural that the spot nearest the sun
should be the first to produce animate natures' (φύσεις ἐμψύχους).

804. lincunt: secuto 3, 553.-sp0nte sua ete: throughout the
passage the implicationis that the living things spontaneously pro

tions of existence. This is in opposition to the teaching of Empedocles,
that the different parts ol animals and men grew up separately out of
the earth, being at length united into beings through Love. Cf. n.
to 1, 716. Lucr. agrees with Empedocles, however, in supposing that
