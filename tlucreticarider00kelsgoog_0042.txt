LUCRETIUS AS A PHILOSOPHER xxxv

The power of voluntary movement and free-will are due to that
swerving of atoms in the void. Had this uot occurred he would
have been bound and controlled by inexorable necessity.1 But
since there is freedom oi will, man has in his own hands the
shaping of his character and the directing of his life.2 The
supreme good is happiness; which may be found indeed iu
pleasures of the body under proper restraint, but principally in
perfect peace of mind, like that of the gods. Life is short and
ought to be enjoyed.⁸ The greatest ills are those corroding
fears ofrthe supernatural and the hereafter ulrich religion has
inspired‚ and which vex men and weigh thern down under a bur-
den of dread. These the philosopher will entirely overcome.⁴
Death ends all. For the wise it has no terrors; indeed, when
the pains of life prevail over its pleasures one may rightly take
refuge in it.5 He will make the most of existence who ministers
frugally to the body’s simple ueeds, and free from the mad nm·
bitions and feverish passions of the masses, never disturbed by
anything‚ holds to the last the ‘high and serene places well for·
tified hythe learning of the wise,'⁰ aud meets his eud with
untroubled breast.

The history of the race reveals a continual progression from
a lower to a higher stage. The primitive men were utterly
savage. They were of larger and sturdier frame than those of
today, aud lived like brutes. Their food was acorns and berries,
their drink the running water. Dwelliugs they had not; they
took refuge from the elements in woods and caves. Sometimes
they followed wild beasts with clubs‚ sometimes were pursued
lutum, aud often in the night were driven in terror from their
leaf-strewu beds. Still, the death-rate was not greater than
now; for there were no wars, none fell victims to the dangers of
the sea, and men were innocent of the use of poisons.⁷ The
