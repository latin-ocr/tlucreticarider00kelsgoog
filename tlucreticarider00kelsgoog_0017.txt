x INTRODUCTION

age at forty-four at the time of death, he was born late in Β. c.
99 or in the earlier part of 98.

The name Lucretius was famous in Roman annals from an
early date. The stock‚ or family, to which it belonged was
primarily patriciam but in the poet’s day had at least three ple-
beian branclres, all of good standing, with the surnames Gallus,
Ofella, and Vespillo. lt is known from coins that there was a
Lucretius Trio, who was probably of plebeian parentage. The
patrician Lucretii had the surname Tricipitini, but gave to
history no distinguished character after the third century Β. c.
The name Carus is not found elsewhere coupled with Lucretius.l
But Titus, as Munro has noticed‚² was a not infrequent praeno·
men among the Lucretii Tricipitini; this slight clue perhaps
males it probable that from them the poet sprung. That his
rank was high is evident from the poem itself. He was thor-
oughly imbued with the culture of the time; and education was
then a boon in the reach only of the upper classes. ln his dedi·
cation he addresses the well-known and influential Memmius
as friend and equal ;8 not with the tone of inferior to patron, as
of Horace to Maecenas. Scenes of luxury are familiar to him3
and he touches on them not with the air of a novice in high life,
but of one who had always been in the midst of elegant sur-
roundings.⁴ Regarding the circumstances of his education ancl
the moulding influences of his life, as we know absolutely noth·
ing, it is idle to speculate.

The story oi Lucretius' madness has been much enlarged
upon, ancl has surrounded his name with a romantio halo.⁵
Possibly it is a myth, framed and circulated by those envious
of his ability and hostile to his doctrine. At any rate, no men-
tion seems to have been made of it before the time of Suetonius
from whom doubtless Jerome drew his account.⁸ lndeed the
