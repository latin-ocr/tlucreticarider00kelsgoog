defective verb, having no perfect stem. It is a favorite word of Luca,
but it is not found in Cic. nor the Augustan writers except in quota·
tions from the earlier period. The root-meaning (cf. Gk. κλύειν
Lat. (cilones) is often obscure, and cluere, as here, almost: esse·
See Neue, ‘Formenlehre’ ii. 426. rao. etsi: = καίτοι, ‘and yet,'
slightly corrective of the preceding statement,-a use not uneom·
mon in both prose and verse. So in prose quamquam is often used,
especially by Cic-esse: = existere-Acherusia etc: the poet
had in mind a passage from Ennius' tragedy ‘Andomache,' part of
which is preserved by Varro (t. L. 7,6 Miiller3 see Vahlcn's Enn.
p. 102) :-

pallida leti, obmiblla tenebris atris, aeternis loca.

-templaz in the earlier writers, particularly Ennius, and after him
Luca, whom in this usage Manilius imitates, templum often has the
derivative meaning of a ‘space marked off ’ (root tem, ci. τέμ-νω).
Varro (L. L. 7, 6) remarks that it may be applied to places in the
heavens or on the earth or under the earth. This signification of tem·
pla was especially common in the language oi augury‚ referring either
to the divisions of the sky or to places chosen for observation; for the
latter use cf. Liv. ι, 6. Trans. by ‘places’ ‘regions’ ⁴ quarters,’ accord·
ing to the connection. 122. ‘though in our passage thither neither
our souls nor bodies hold together! 123. simulacra: exactly
what these ‘images ' or ‘idols ’ were supposed to be it is difiicult to
say. They seem to have been conceived of as intangible, immaterial
forms, just like the body in appearance, which went to Hades while
the soul departed elsewhere. According to the implied meaning of
the present passage the simulacra were in the lower world. while the
soul passed on through living bodies. For Ennius supposed Homer's
soul tvas in himself, but speaks of the ‘image' (speciem) as appearing
to him. A like separation of soul and image is perhaps implied in
Verg. Aen. 4, 385, where in substance Dido says that when death shall
have severed soul and body, as a shade (umbra) she will be present in
all places, while report of Aeneas’ sufferings will come to her to the
lowest parts oi Hades (ad imos manes); but see Conington’s nn.
