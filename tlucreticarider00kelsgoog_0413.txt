348 LUCRETIUS [V. 336-

perfircilis, sive quod invitabantur inlecebris blandis voluptatis, sive etiam,
qnia nibil erat prolatum melius, illud, qnod erat, tenebant. See Ritter,
‘Hist ol Phil.’ iv. 82-3; Zeller, ‘Stolos Ep.‚ and Scep) ch. 15, e,
Reid’s ‘Academica’ Introd. pp. 26-73 cf. nn. to 20, andr, 2 53 1, 928-
930. 339. saecla. see nn. to 1, 20 and 202. -vaporet see n: to
1, 491. 34ο. vexamine: found only here. 342. cooperu-
isse: pronounced as it ciperuisse; ci. 6, 491 cbyterr'nnt, ior cooperiunt.
So 3, 861 deerrarunn 1, 711 derrassu see n. to 1, 43. 343. ne·
cessest: see n. to 1,27ο. 345 etseq. A similar argument is used
3, 592 et seq. to show that the soul perishes with the body; cf. espe-
cially 346-7 with 3, 602. 345. periclis: Epicurus held that all
the innumerable worlds would be destroyed, some in one way, some
in another. Cf. Diog. Laert. 10, 73 ‘All (the worlds) must be again
dissolved‚ some more rapidly, some more slowly, and some from
one cause, some from another) ct. Plut. Plac. 2, 4. 359. atque:
seen. to 1, 281.

6. Wbatew is imperisbable must either possess α nature nmfflcted
by blozns, or must nat be exposed to blacos, or must boue no surrounding
void into wbicb it can be dissolved. Tbe world meets none of lbere condi·
bians, bcncs is doonred. Hence, too, we know it bad a beginning ; for, be·
ing perisbable, it could not bave snruitnd from an infinite past. 3 51-

tur: see n. to 1, 441. 359. loci: as in r, 482, where see n.
36ο. quo: :in quern. 361. summarum summa: the uni-
verse; summo rerwn is used with the same signification3 cf. n. to 1,
²35· With 361-3 cf. 2, 303-7. 362. qui: = aliqui ; as Munro
remarks, “ you would expect ullus lor qnisquam), just asin 359 nulla
locifit coprh.‘' 364. uti docui: 1, 329 et sea-mundi: the
universe is imperishable, but the world is not. 367. ex infinito:
refers to space; cf. n. to 1, 1001. Epicurus taught that the space
between the worlds (μεταξὺ κόσμων διάστημα, or μετακόσμιον) was
not absolutely void, but contained more or less stray matter. See
Diog. Laert. 10, 89. How his gods managed to pass an undisturhed
and ever-blessed existence there, it is hard to imagine. 373. leti

⁴ ianua: see n. to 1, 1112.
