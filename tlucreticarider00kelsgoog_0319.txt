⁴ 254 LUCRETIUS [Ι. 418·

’ 3. Matter and void alone make up the universe
418-482.

There is matter, there is void (418-429). Besides matter and void
there is no third nature (430-448). Wtaeever existe is either a property
or an accident os matter and void (449-482).

418. ‘But now to proceed to weave throughout in verse the design
begun’ 419. ut est: ‘as it is,’ ‘as it stands.³ Munro in his 3rd
edit. takes per se with ut est and trans. ‘all nature, then, as it exists
, by itseli,' which does not seem to make as good sense as the other
constr.; but see his n. 420. constitit in: ‘is made up oi! With
this meaning consistere is followed by the simple abl. or by the abl. with
