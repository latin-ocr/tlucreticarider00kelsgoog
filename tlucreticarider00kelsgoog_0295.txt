80. Illud: refers to something following, -a common use in both
prose and verse. A. 102, ὸς G. 292, Rern. 13 H. 450, 3. Illud in his
rebus is a iavorite phrase oi our poet in introducing a new point. Cf.
1, 370; 1,1o52; 3, 370 etc. 81. inpia: less common than the as·
similated iorm impia. The early Romans metwith stern disfavor any·
thing that tended to weaken the hold oi the old religion upon the
people. Cato the Censor viewed with alarm the stay oi Carneades and
his tellowphilosophers at Rome, though they were on public business.
In the poet's day, however, the educated classes no longer accepted lit·
erally the myths of the old faith, and the public religious rites became
merely an instrument in the hands oi designing politicians iot control·
ling the credulous masses. It is not likely that Memmius and his friends
would have been greatly shocked by any doctrine the poet might pre
pound; but this passage shows wonderful skill in meeting possible
prejudices, and arousing the teelings to atavorable reception oi what-
ever might follow. 82. indugredi: :ingredi Indu and endu are
old iorms for in. The Twelve Tables have endo with both acc. and abl.
Ennius uses endo with the acc, tudo with the abl. Plautus has indu
only in the verb indaudire. Lucr. has indu manu (2, 1096), endo mari
(6, 890) and indu uranus (5, 102), besides endu in several compounds.
The old torm survived to the Classical period in such words as indi·
geo, indigena, industria- quod contra: :h reducuntur ‘whereas on
the contrary) Contra is herc an adv, as generally in anteelassical
writers; quadis merely a connecting link between the clauses, as in quod
si at the beginning oi sentences and clauses and the like3 it was origi·
nally an adv. acc, or perhaps, assume maintain‚ an abl. in the sense
of qua re, quom obrem. Cf. Cic. De Sen. 23, 843 De Am. 24, 90 and
Reid’s n. cf. also use oi h in Thuc. a, 40 b τοῖς ἄλλοις ἀμαθία μὲν
θράσος κτλ, and the ‘which’ often in vulgar English. See Roby 1897
