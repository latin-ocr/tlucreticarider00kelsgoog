376 LUCRETIUS [V. 1107-

undistlnguished, will be listeners, who usually do no more than ex·
press from time to time assent or dissent.’' Spencer goes on to show
how in each group usually there would be some one superior to all
the rest, who would have “more than an individual share ’' of influ-
ence. Such would correspond perhaps to Lucretius’ reges. 1110.
Notice that Lucr. conceives ot property as at first held in common ς
and that the form he mentions first is stock. Did he assume a pas·
toral state intermediate between the agricultural and utter savagery?
The Romans themselves recognized the derivatlon of pecum'o from
pecus,· cf. Varro L. L. 5, 95 pecus, a quo pecunia um'mrsa, quod in pc-
core pecunia tum consistebat pastoribus. 1111. facie: cf. 1114 pul·
chris ; 1116 pulchro corpore ,- refers to the entire appearance ol a man.
Modern writers on the development of civilization attribute great im·
portance to physical prowess and superior ability, but less to mere
appearance than our poet. Darwin, however, discusses fully the bear-
ing 01 beauty on the progress of the race through lts influencing the
selection of partners in marriage: see ‘Descent ol Man,’ ii. 326—338.
1113. res: ‘wealth’ The ancient poets often inveighed against gold
as the “root of all evil.” Cf. Ov. Met. 1, 135 ct seq.:—

communemque prius, ceu lumina solis et auras,
cautus humum longo signavit limite mensor.

. . . itum estin viscera terrae;
quasque recondiderat Stygiisque admoverat umbris,
effodiuntur opes, inritamenta malorum

also Verg. Aen. 3, 5 5 quid non mortalia pectora cogis, Auri sacro firmes.
1117 et seq. Ethical reflections like these, interspersed throughout
the poem, testily to the poet’s earnestness of purpose. With 1117-9
cf. 2, ²0·333 Epicurus, Diog. Laert. 10, 130 ‘And we think content·
ment a great good, not that we may altogether put up with a little,
but that if we have not much we may use the little, being fully per·
suaded that those most enjoy abundance who would the least feel the
lack of it; and that while everything that is natural is easy to get,
whatever is useless is hard to procure,' etc.; ef. also Id. 10, 144 and
146. Contentment with a little was a lavorite theme oi Horace3 the
wise man, the Epicurean said, could live happily on bread and water.
The luxurious tendencies oi later Epicureans arose from emphasizlng
the doctrine of pleasure inculcated by their master above that of sell-
control and rational enjoyment. 1119. penuria parvi: alittle
