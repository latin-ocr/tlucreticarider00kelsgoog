and equivalence” ol physical, vital, and mental forces, as stated,
eg, by Herbert Spencer, ‘First Prin! ξ 71 : but see Bowne‚ ‘ Phil. ot
Herb. Spencer‚' p. 90 et seq. Consult Maudsley ‘Body and Mind,’
especially sect3 on the “relation ot morbid bodily states to mental
functions” 462. quoque: i.e., ol death as well as disease; with
esse supply euin. De La Mettrie makes this line the conclusion ol his
‘Histoire naturelle de l'dme‚’ in which some ot these arguments of
Lucr. and many others against the soul's immortality‚ are set forth.
