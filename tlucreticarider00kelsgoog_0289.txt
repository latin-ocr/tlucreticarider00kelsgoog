notwithstanding Lucullus· popularity, the triumph was obtained only
with the greatest difficulty. As praetor in 58 Memmius showed the
· same spirit and courage, which, however, were devoted to purely par·

this time, later seeing it would be to his advantage to joi'n Caesar’s
party he shamelessly went over to it, and accepted the aid of his
former enemy in presenting himself as candidate ior the consulship
in 542 He soon proved laithless to Caesar, and being impeached
ior election bribery he leit Rome in disgrace,and went to live at Mity-
lene. This happened aiter Lucretius’ death. Memmius had some
power as an orator3 but Cicero says oi him that his adherence to
Greek models and his dislike oi hard work interiered with his success
in this direction. He dabbled in verses oi questionable propriety, and
his life was grossly immoral. Probably it was the dash and audacity

ers shaping the world's destiny suggests the antithesis between Love
and Striie (Φιλία or Φιλότης and Νεῖκος) that runs through the philoso·
phy oi Empedocles. 32. Mavors: old and fuller form oi Mars, .
found also occasionally in the later poets. 34. vulnere amoris:
vulnus antoris became later a stock phrase in Roman litergture. Its
