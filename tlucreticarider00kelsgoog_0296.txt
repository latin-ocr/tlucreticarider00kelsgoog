85. Iphianassai: lptt'anassa = Ἰφιάνασσα, Homeric for Ἰφιγέιιεια,
Iphigenia, the daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra. When the
Grecian lieet was gathered at Aulis in Boeotia ior the expedition against
Troy and detained by storms, Chalcas being summoned declared that
Agamemnon had given offence to Diana, and that this could be
atoned for only by the sacrifice oi his daughter Iphigenia to the
goddess. Thereupon‚ under pretence of marriage to Achilles, the
maid was brought to Aulis ; but just as she was about to be offered
up Diana bore her on high to Tauris, where she became a priestess in
the temple. This is the common form of the legend; but Lucr, to
add force to his argument, assumes that she was really sacrificed as a
victim. The story ot Iphigenia was a lavorite theme ot the classic
writers. lt formed the basis of a master tragedy by Euripides,
and in modern times hasbeen splendidly handled by Racine in his
‘Iphigenie en Aulide,' and by Goethe in the ‘Iphigenie aut Tauris?

tive gen. alter the neuter pl. ot an adj. is very common in Lucr, tak-
ing the place of the ordinary constr. of a noun with adj. in agreement.
