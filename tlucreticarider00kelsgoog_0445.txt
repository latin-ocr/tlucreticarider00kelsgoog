it, and then prostrated himseli.'’-lapidem: may refer to a statue
made of stone, or to the rough blocks of stone like the termini. at
which the passer-by paused to offer worship. 1203. mage:
rarer form 01 magis, found also 4, 81 and 756. The Epicureans main·
tained that the gods should be worshipped, but only on account oi
their exalted and immortal nature. Ci. Cic. N. D. 1, 17, 45 nam etprae-
stans deorum natura hominum pietate coleretur, cum et aeterna esset et
beatissima-tabet enim venerationem iustam quiequid excellit-et me-
tus omnis a vi atque ira deorum pulsus esset etc. 1206. viarum:
the expression venire in mentem is considered as equivalent to a verb

oi remembering‚ and is hence used with the gen.; ‘we think oi the

ci. n. to 1, 715. 1233. vis abdita quaedam: what Lucr. meant
by this it is difficult to say ; probably he was thinking of the unseen

ment of the highest power and the greatest glory that man could
